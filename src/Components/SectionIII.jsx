    Section III. Reporting Additional Diagnoses 
  </h2>
  <p>"GENERAL RULES FOR OTHER (ADDITIONAL) DIAGNOSES"</p>
  <p>
    For reporting purposes, the definition for “other diagnoses” is interpreted
    as additional conditions that affect patient care in terms of requiring:
    clinical evaluation; or therapeutic treatment; or diagnostic procedures; or
    extended length of hospital stay; or increased nursing care and/or
    monitoring.
  </p>
  <p>
    The UHDDS item #11-b defines Other Diagnoses as “all conditions that coexist
    at the time of admission, that develop subsequently, or that affect the
    treatment received and/or the length of stay. Diagnoses that relate to an
    earlier episode which have no bearing on the current hospital stay are to be
    excluded.” UHDDS definitions apply to inpatients in acute care, short-term,
    long term care and psychiatric hospital setting. The UHDDS definitions are
    used by acute care short-term hospitals to report inpatient data elements in
    a standardized manner. These data elements and their definitions can be
    found in the July 31, 1985, Federal Register (Vol. 50, No, 147), pp.
    31038-40.

  <p>Page 104 of 115</p>
  <p>
    Since that time, the application of the UHDDS definitions has been expanded
    to include all non-outpatient settings (acute care, short term, long term
    care and psychiatric hospitals; home health agencies; rehab facilities;
    nursing homes, etc.). The UHDDS definitions also apply to hospice services
    (all levels of care). The following guidelines are to be applied in
    designating “other diagnoses” when neither the Alphabetic Index nor the
    Tabular List in ICD-10-CM provide direction. The listing of the diagnoses in
    the patient record is the responsibility of the attending provider.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IIIA">A. Previous conditions</h3>
  <p>
    If the provider has included a diagnosis in the final diagnostic statement,
    such as the discharge summary or the face sheet, it should ordinarily be
    coded. Some providers include in the diagnostic statement resolved
    conditions or diagnoses and status-post procedures from previous admissions
    that have no bearing on the current stay. Such conditions are not to be
    reported and are coded only if required by hospital policy. However, history
    codes (categories Z80-Z87) may be used as secondary codes if the historical
    condition or family history has an impact on current care or influences
    treatment.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IIIB">B. Abnormal findings</h3>
  <p>
    Abnormal findings (laboratory, x-ray, pathologic, and other diagnostic
    results) are not coded and reported unless the provider indicates their
    clinical significance. If the findings are outside the normal range and the
    attending provider has ordered other tests to evaluate the condition or
    prescribed treatment, it is appropriate to ask the provider whether the
    abnormal finding should be added. Please note: This differs from the coding
    practices in the outpatient setting for coding encounters for diagnostic
    tests that have been interpreted by a provider.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IIIC">C. Uncertain Diagnosis</h3>
  <p>
    If the diagnosis documented at the time of discharge is qualified as
    “probable,” “suspected,” “likely,” “questionable,” “possible,” or “still to
    be ruled out,” “compatible with,” “consistent with,” or other similar terms
    indicating uncertainty, code the condition as if it existed or was
    established. The bases for these guidelines are the diagnostic workup,
    arrangements for further workup or observation, and initial therapeutic
    approach that correspond most closely with the established diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: This guideline is applicable only to inpatient admissions to
    short-term, acute, long-term care and psychiatric hospitals.
