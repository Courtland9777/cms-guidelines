  <h2 id="sectionII">Section II. Selection of Principal Diagnosis</h2>
  <p>
    The circumstances of inpatient admission always govern the selection of
    principal diagnosis. The principal diagnosis is defined in the Uniform
    Hospital Discharge Data Set (UHDDS) as “that condition established after
    study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient
    to the hospital for care.”
  </p>
  <p>Page 101 of 115</p>
  <p>
    The UHDDS definitions are used by hospitals to report inpatient data
    elements in a standardized manner. These data elements and their definitions
    can be found in the July 31, 1985, Federal Register (Vol. 50, No, 147), pp.
    31038-40. Since that time, the application of the UHDDS definitions has been
    expanded to include all non-outpatient settings (acute care, short term,
    long term care and psychiatric hospitals; home health agencies; rehab
    facilities; nursing homes, etc.). The UHDDS definitions also apply to
    hospice services (all levels of care). In determining principal diagnosis,
    coding conventions in the ICD-10-CM, the Tabular List and Alphabetic Index
    take precedence over these official coding guidelines. (See Section I.A.,
    Conventions for the ICD-10-CM)
  </p>
  <p>
    The importance of consistent, complete documentation in the medical record
    cannot be overemphasized. Without such documentation the application of all
    coding guidelines is a difficult, if not impossible, task.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IIA">A. Codes for symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions</h3>
  <p>
    Codes for symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions from Chapter 18 are
    not to be used as principal diagnosis when a related definitive diagnosis
    has been established.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IIB">
    B. Two or more interrelated conditions, each potentially meeting the
    definition for principal diagnosis.
  </h3>
  <p>
    When there are two or more interrelated conditions (such as diseases in the
    same ICD-10-CM chapter or manifestations characteristically associated with
    a certain disease) potentially meeting the definition of principal
    diagnosis, either condition may be sequenced first, unless the circumstances
    of the admission, the therapy provided, the Tabular List, or the Alphabetic
    Index indicate otherwise.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IIC">
    C. Two or more diagnoses that equally meet the definition for principal
    diagnosis
  </h3>
  <p>
    In the unusual instance when two or more diagnoses equally meet the criteria
    for principal diagnosis as determined by the circumstances of admission,
    diagnostic workup and/or therapy provided, and the Alphabetic Index, Tabular
    List, or another coding guidelines does not provide sequencing direction,
    any one of the diagnoses may be sequenced first.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IID">D. Two or more comparative or contrasting conditions</h3>
  <p>
    In those rare instances when two or more contrasting or comparative
    diagnoses are documented as “either/or” (or similar terminology), they are
    coded as if the diagnoses were confirmed and the diagnoses are sequenced
    according to the circumstances of the admission. If no further determination
    can be made as to which diagnosis should be principal, either diagnosis may
    be sequenced first.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IIE">
    E. A symptom(s) followed by contrasting/comparative diagnoses
  </h3>
  <p>"GUIDELINE HAS BEEN DELETED EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2014"</p>
  <p>Page 102 of 115</p>
  <h3 id="IIF">F. Original treatment plan not carried out</h3>
  <p>
    Sequence as the principal diagnosis the condition, which after study
    occasioned the admission to the hospital, even though treatment may not have
    been carried out due to unforeseen circumstances.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IIG">G. Complications of surgery and other medical care</h3>
  <p>
    When the admission is for treatment of a complication resulting from surgery
    or other medical care, the complication code is sequenced as the principal
    diagnosis. If the complication is classified to the T80-T88 series and the
    code lacks the necessary specificity in describing the complication, an
    additional code for the specific complication should be assigned.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IIH">H. Uncertain Diagnosis</h3>
  <p>
    If the diagnosis documented at the time of discharge is qualified as
    “probable,” “suspected,” “likely,” “questionable,” “possible,” or “still to
    be ruled out,” “compatible with,” “consistent with,” or other similar terms
    indicating uncertainty, code the condition as if it existed or was
    established. The bases for these guidelines are the diagnostic workup,
    arrangements for further workup or observation, and initial therapeutic
    approach that correspond most closely with the established diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: This guideline is applicable only to inpatient admissions to
    short-term, acute, long-term care and psychiatric hospitals.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IIiJK">I,J,K. Admission from OBS, OP Surgery, Rehab</h3>
  <h4 id="IIi">I. Admission from Observation Unit</h4>
  <h4>1. Admission Following Medical Observation</h4>
  <p>
    When a patient is admitted to an observation unit for a medical condition,
    which either worsens or does not improve, and is subsequently admitted as an
    inpatient of the same hospital for this same medical condition, the
    principal diagnosis would be the medical condition which led to the hospital
    admission.
  </p>
  <h4>2. Admission Following Post-Operative Observation</h4>
  <p>
    When a patient is admitted to an observation unit to monitor a condition (or
    complication) that develops following outpatient surgery, and then is
    subsequently admitted as an inpatient of the same hospital, hospitals should
    apply the Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set (UHDDS) definition of
    principal diagnosis as "that condition established after study to be chiefly
    responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for
    care."
  </p>
  <h4 id="IIJ">J. Admission from Outpatient Surgery</h4>
  <p>
    When a patient receives surgery in the hospital's outpatient surgery
    department and is subsequently admitted for continuing inpatient care at the
    same hospital, the following guidelines should be followed in selecting the
    principal diagnosis for the inpatient admission:
  </p>
  <p>
    • If the reason for the inpatient admission is a complication, assign the
    complication as the principal diagnosis. <br/> • If no complication, or other
    condition, is documented as the reason for the inpatient admission, assign
    the reason for the outpatient surgery as the principal diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>Page 103 of 115</p>
  <p>
    • If the reason for the inpatient admission is another condition unrelated
    to the surgery, assign the unrelated condition as the principal diagnosis.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IIK">K. Admissions/Encounters for Rehabilitation</h4>
  <p>
    When the purpose for the admission/encounter is rehabilitation, sequence
    first the code for the condition for which the service is being performed.
    For example, for an admission/encounter for rehabilitation for right-sided
    dominant hemiplegia following a cerebrovascular infarction, report code
    I69.351, Hemiplegia and hemiparesis following cerebral infarction affecting
    right dominant side, as the first-listed or principal diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the condition for which the rehabilitation service is being provided is
    no longer present, report the appropriate aftercare code as the first-listed
    or principal diagnosis, unless the rehabilitation service is being provided
    following an injury. For rehabilitation services following active treatment
    of an injury, assign the injury code with the appropriate seventh character
    for subsequent encounter as the first-listed or principal diagnosis. For
    example, if a patient with severe degenerative osteoarthritis of the hip,
    underwent hip replacement and the current encounter/admission is for
    rehabilitation, report code Z47.1, Aftercare following joint replacement
    surgery, as the first-listed or principal diagnosis. If the patient requires
    rehabilitation post hip replacement for right intertrochanteric femur
    fracture, report code S72.141D, Displaced intertrochanteric fracture of
    right femur, subsequent encounter for closed fracture with routine healing,
    as the first-listed or principal diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    See Section I.C.21.c.7, Factors influencing health states and contact with
    health services, Aftercare. See Section I.C.19.a, for additional information
    about the use of 7th characters for injury codes.
