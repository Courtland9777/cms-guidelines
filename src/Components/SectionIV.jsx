    Section IV. Diagnostic Coding and Reporting Guidelines for Outpatient
    Services
  </h2>
  <p>
    These coding guidelines for outpatient diagnoses have been approved for use
    by hospitals/ providers in coding and reporting hospital-based outpatient
    services and provider-based office visits. Guidelines in Section I,
    Conventions, general coding guidelines and chapter-specific guidelines,
    should also be applied for outpatient services and office visits.
    Information about the use of certain abbreviations, punctuation, symbols,
    and other conventions used in the ICD-10-CM Tabular List (code numbers and
    titles), can be found in Section IA of these guidelines,
  </p>
  <p>Page 105 of 115</p>
  <p>
    under “Conventions Used in the Tabular List.” Section I.B. contains general
    guidelines that apply to the entire classification. Section I.C. contains
    chapter-specific guidelines that correspond to the chapters as they are
    arranged in the classification. Information about the correct sequence to
    use in finding a code is also described in Section I. The terms encounter
    and visit are often used interchangeably in describing outpatient service
    contacts and, therefore, appear together in these guidelines without
    distinguishing one from the other. Though the conventions and general
    guidelines apply to all settings, coding guidelines for outpatient and
    provider reporting of diagnoses will vary in a number of instances from
    those for inpatient diagnoses, recognizing that: The Uniform Hospital
    Discharge Data Set (UHDDS) definition of principal diagnosis does not apply
    to hospital-based outpatient services and provider-based office visits.
    Coding guidelines for inconclusive diagnoses (probable, suspected, rule out,
    etc.) were developed for inpatient reporting and do not apply to
    outpatients.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IVA">A. Selection of first-listed condition</h3>
  <p>
    In the outpatient setting, the term first-listed diagnosis is used in lieu
    of principal diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    In determining the first-listed diagnosis the coding conventions of
    ICD-10-CM, as well as the general and disease specific guidelines take
    precedence over the outpatient guidelines. Diagnoses often are not
    established at the time of the initial encounter/visit. It may take two or
    more visits before the diagnosis is confirmed. The most critical rule
    involves beginning the search for the correct code assignment through the
    Alphabetic Index. Never begin searching initially in the Tabular List as
    this will lead to coding errors.
  </p>
  <h4>1. Outpatient Surgery</h4>
  <p>
    When a patient presents for outpatient surgery (same day surgery), code the
    reason for the surgery as the first-listed diagnosis (reason for the
    encounter), even if the surgery is not performed due to a contraindication.
  </p>
  <h4>2. Observation Stay</h4>
  <p>
    When a patient is admitted for observation for a medical condition, assign a
    code for the medical condition as the first-listed diagnosis. When a patient
    presents for outpatient surgery and develops complications requiring
    admission to observation, code the reason for the surgery as the first
    reported diagnosis (reason for the encounter), followed by codes for the
    complications as secondary diagnoses.
  </p>
  <p>Page 106 of 115</p>
  <h3 id="IVB">B. Codes from A00.0 through T88.9, Z00-Z99, U00-U85</h3>
  <p>
    The appropriate code(s) from A00.0 through T88.9, Z00-Z99 and U00-U85 must
    be used to identify diagnoses, symptoms, conditions, problems, complaints,
    or other reason(s) for the encounter/visit.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IVC">C. Accurate reporting of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes</h3>
  <p>
    For accurate reporting of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, the documentation
    should describe the patient’s condition, using terminology which includes
    specific diagnoses as well as symptoms, problems, or reasons for the
    encounter. There are ICD-10-CM codes to describe all of these.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IVD">D. Codes that describe symptoms and signs</h3>
  <p>
    Codes that describe symptoms and signs, as opposed to diagnoses, are
    acceptable for reporting purposes when a diagnosis has not been established
    (confirmed) by the provider. Chapter 18 of ICD-10-CM, Symptoms, Signs, and
    Abnormal Clinical and Laboratory Findings Not Elsewhere Classified (codes
    R00-R99) contain many, but not all codes for symptoms.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IVE">E. Encounters for circumstances other than a disease or injury</h3>
  <p>
    ICD-10-CM provides codes to deal with encounters for circumstances other
    than a disease or injury. The Factors Influencing Health Status and Contact
    with Health Services codes (Z00Z99) are provided to deal with occasions when
    circumstances other than a disease or injury are recorded as diagnosis or
    problems. See Section I.C.21. Factors influencing health status and contact
    with health services.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IVF">
    F. Level of Detail in Coding 
  </h3>
  <h4>1. ICD-10-CM codes with 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 characters</h4>
  <p>
    ICD-10-CM is composed of codes with 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 characters. Codes with
    three characters are included in ICD-10-CM as the heading of a category of
    codes that may be further subdivided by the use of fourth, fifth, sixth or
    seventh characters to provide greater specificity.
  </p>
  <h4>2. Use of full number of characters required for a code</h4>
  <p>
    A three-character code is to be used only if it is not further subdivided. A
    code is invalid if it has not been coded to the full number of characters
    required for that code, including the 7th character, if applicable.
  </p>
  <h4>3. Highest level of specificity</h4>
  <h3 id="IVG">
    G. Highest level
  </h3>
  <h4>
  G. Code to the highest level of specificity when supported by the medical
    record documentation.
  </h4>
  <p>
    ICD-10-CM code for the diagnosis, condition, problem, or other reason for
    encounter/visit
  </p>
  <p>
    List first the ICD-10-CM code for the diagnosis, condition, problem, or
    other reason for encounter/visit shown in the medical record to be chiefly
    responsible for the services provided. List additional codes that describe
    any coexisting conditions. In some cases, the first-listed diagnosis may be
    a symptom when a diagnosis has not been established (confirmed) by the
    provider.
  </p>
  <p>Page 107 of 115</p>
  <h3 id="IVH">H. Uncertain diagnosis</h3>
  <p>
    Do not code diagnoses documented as “probable”, “suspected,” “questionable,”
    “rule out,” “compatible with,” “consistent with,” or “working diagnosis” or
    other similar terms indicating uncertainty. Rather, code the condition(s) to
    the highest degree of certainty for that encounter/visit, such as symptoms,
    signs, abnormal test results, or other reason for the visit. Please note:
    This differs from the coding practices used by short-term, acute care,
    long-term care and psychiatric hospitals.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IVI">I. Chronic diseases</h3>
  <p>
    Chronic diseases treated on an ongoing basis may be coded and reported as
    many times as the patient receives treatment and care for the condition(s)
  </p>
  <h3 id="IVJ">J. Code all documented conditions that coexist</h3>
  <p>
    Code all documented conditions that coexist at the time of the
    encounter/visit and that require or affect patient care, treatment or
    management. Do not code conditions that were previously treated and no
    longer exist. However, history codes (categories Z80-Z87) may be used as
    secondary codes if the historical condition or family history has an impact
    on current care or influences treatment.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IVK">K. Patients receiving diagnostic services only</h3>
  <p>
    For patients receiving diagnostic services only during an encounter/visit,
    sequence first the diagnosis, condition, problem, or other reason for
    encounter/visit shown in the medical record to be chiefly responsible for
    the outpatient services provided during the encounter/visit. Codes for other
    diagnoses (e.g., chronic conditions) may be sequenced as additional
    diagnoses. For encounters for routine laboratory/radiology testing in the
    absence of any signs, symptoms, or associated diagnosis, assign Z01.89,
    Encounter for other specified special examinations. If routine testing is
    performed during the same encounter as a test to evaluate a sign, symptom,
    or diagnosis, it is appropriate to assign both the Z code and the code
    describing the reason for the non-routine test.
  </p>
  <p>
    For outpatient encounters for diagnostic tests that have been interpreted by
    a physician, and the final report is available at the time of coding, code
    any confirmed or definitive diagnosis(es) documented in the interpretation.
    Do not code related signs and symptoms as additional diagnoses. Please note:
    This differs from the coding practice in the hospital inpatient setting
    regarding abnormal findings on test results.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IVL">L. Patients receiving therapeutic services only</h3>
  <p>
    For patients receiving therapeutic services only during an encounter/visit,
    sequence first the diagnosis, condition, problem, or other reason for
    encounter/visit shown in the medical record to be chiefly responsible for
    the outpatient services provided during the encounter/visit. Codes for other
    diagnoses (e.g., chronic conditions) may be sequenced as additional
    diagnoses.
  </p>
  <p>Page 108 of 115</p>
  <p>
    The only exception to this rule is that when the primary reason for the
    admission/encounter is chemotherapy or radiation therapy, the appropriate Z
    code for the service is listed first, and the diagnosis or problem for which
    the service is being performed listed second.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IVM">M. Patients receiving preoperative evaluations only</h3>
  <p>
    For patients receiving preoperative evaluations only, sequence first a code
    from subcategory Z01.81, Encounter for pre-procedural examinations, to
    describe the pre-op consultations. Assign a code for the condition to
    describe the reason for the surgery as an additional diagnosis. Code also
    any findings related to the pre-op evaluation.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IVN">N. Ambulatory surgery</h3>
  <p>
    For ambulatory surgery, code the diagnosis for which the surgery was
    performed. If the postoperative diagnosis is known to be different from the
    preoperative diagnosis at the time the diagnosis is confirmed, select the
    postoperative diagnosis for coding, since it is the most definitive.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IVO">O. Routine outpatient prenatal visits</h3>
  <p>See Section I.C.15. Routine outpatient prenatal visits.</p>
  <p>
    P. Encounters for general medical examinations with abnormal findings The
    subcategories for encounters for general medical examinations, Z00.0- and
    encounter for routine child health examination, Z00.12-, provide codes for
    with and without abnormal findings. Should a general medical examination
    result in an abnormal finding, the code for general medical examination with
    abnormal finding should be assigned as the first-listed diagnosis. An
    examination with abnormal findings refers to a condition/diagnosis that is
    newly identified or a change in severity of a chronic condition (such as
    uncontrolled hypertension, or an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive
    pulmonary disease) during a routine physical examination. A secondary code
    for the abnormal finding should also be coded.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IVQ">Q. Encounters for routine health screenings</h3>
