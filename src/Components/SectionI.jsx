    Section I. Conventions, general coding guidelines and chapter specific
    guidelines
  </h2>
  <p>
    The conventions, general guidelines and chapter-specific guidelines are
    applicable to all health care settings unless otherwise indicated. The
    conventions and instructions of the classification take precedence over
    guidelines.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IA">A. Conventions for the ICD-10-CM</h4>
  <p>
    The conventions for the ICD-10-CM are the general rules for use of the
    classification independent of the guidelines. These conventions are
    incorporated within the Alphabetic Index and Tabular List of the ICD-10-CM
    as instructional notes.
  </p>
  <p>1. The Alphabetic Index and Tabular List</p>
  <p>
    The ICD-10-CM is divided into the Alphabetic Index, an alphabetical list of
    terms and their corresponding code, and the Tabular List, a structured list
    of codes divided into chapters based on body system or condition. The
    Alphabetic Index consists of the following parts: the Index of Diseases and
    Injury, the Index of External Causes of Injury, the Table of Neoplasms and
    the Table of Drugs and Chemicals. See Section I.C2. General guidelines See
    Section I.C.19. Adverse effects, poisoning, underdosing and toxic effects
  </p>
  <p>2. Format and Structure:</p>
  <p>
    The ICD-10-CM Tabular List contains categories, subcategories and codes.
    Characters for categories, subcategories and codes may be either a letter or
    a number. All categories are 3 characters. A three-character category that
    has no further subdivision is equivalent to a code. Subcategories are either
    4 or 5 characters. Codes may be 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 characters. That is, each
    level of subdivision after a category is a subcategory. The final level of
    subdivision is a code. Codes that have applicable 7th characters are still
    referred to as codes, not subcategories. A code that has an applicable 7th
    character is considered invalid without the 7th character. The ICD-10-CM
    uses an indented format for ease in reference.
  </p>
  <p>3. Use of codes for reporting purposes</p>
  <p>
    For reporting purposes only codes are permissible, not categories or
    subcategories, and any applicable 7th character is required.
  </p>
  <p>4. Placeholder character</p>
  <p>
    The ICD-10-CM utilizes a placeholder character “X”. The “X” is used as a
    placeholder at certain codes to allow for future expansion. An example of
    this is at the poisoning, adverse effect and underdosing codes, categories
    T36-T50. Where a placeholder exists, the X must be used in order for the
    code to be considered a valid code.
  </p>
  <p> Page 7 of 115</p>
  <p>5. 7th Characters</p>
  <p>6. Abbreviations</p>
  <p>
    Certain ICD-10-CM categories have applicable 7th characters. The applicable
    7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes
    in the Tabular List instruct. The 7th character must always be the 7th
    character in the data field. If a code that requires a 7th character is not
    6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters.
  </p>
  <h5>a. Alphabetic Index abbreviations</h5>
  <p>
    NEC “Not elsewhere classifiable” This abbreviation in the Alphabetic Index
    represents “other specified.” When a specific code is not available for a
    condition, the Alphabetic Index directs the coder to the “other specified”
    code in the Tabular List.
  </p>
  <p>
    NOS “Not otherwise specified” This abbreviation is the equivalent of
    unspecified.
  </p>
  <h5>b. Tabular List abbreviations</h5>
  <p>
    7. NEC “Not elsewhere classifiable” This abbreviation in the Tabular List
    represents “other specified”. When a specific code is not available for a
    condition, the Tabular List includes an NEC entry under a code to identify
    the code as the “other specified” code.
  </p>
  <p>
    NOS “Not otherwise specified” This abbreviation is the equivalent of
    unspecified.
  </p>
  <p>Punctuation</p>
  <p>
    [] Brackets are used in the Tabular List to enclose synonyms, alternative
    wording or explanatory phrases. Brackets are used in the Alphabetic Index to
    identify manifestation codes.
  </p>
  <p>
    () Parentheses are used in both the Alphabetic Index and Tabular List to
    enclose supplementary words that may be present or absent in the statement
    of a disease or procedure without affecting the code number to which it is
    assigned. The terms within the parentheses are referred to as nonessential
    modifiers. The nonessential modifiers in the Alphabetic Index to Diseases
    apply to subterms following a main term except when a nonessential modifier
    and a subentry are mutually exclusive, the subentry takes precedence. For
    example, in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index under the main term Enteritis,
    “acute” is a nonessential modifier and “chronic” is a subentry. In this
    case, the nonessential modifier “acute” does not apply to the subentry
    “chronic”.
  </p>
  <p>Page 8 of 115</p>
  <p>
    8. Colons are used in the Tabular List after an incomplete term which needs
    one or more of the modifiers following the colon to make it assignable to a
    given category.
  </p>
  <p>Use of “and”.</p>
  <p>See Section I.A.14. Use of the term “And”</p>
  <p>9. Other and Unspecified codes</p>
  <h5>a. “Other” codes</h5>
  <p>
    Codes titled “other” or “other specified” are for use when the information
    in the medical record provides detail for which a specific code does not
    exist. Alphabetic Index entries with NEC in the line designate “other” codes
    in the Tabular List. These Alphabetic Index entries represent specific
    disease entities for which no specific code exists, so the term is included
    within an “other” code.
  </p>
  <h5>b. “Unspecified” codes</h5>
  <p>
    Codes titled “unspecified” are for use when the information in the medical
    record is insufficient to assign a more specific code. For those categories
    for which an unspecified code is not provided, the “other specified” code
    may represent both other and unspecified. See Section I.B.18 Use of
    Signs/Symptom/Unspecified Codes
  </p>
  <p>10. Includes Notes</p>
  <p>
    This note appears immediately under a three-character code title to further
    define, or give examples of, the content of the category.
  </p>
  <p>11. Inclusion terms</p>
  <p>
    List of terms is included under some codes. These terms are the conditions
    for which that code is to be used. The terms may be synonyms of the code
    title, or, in the case of “other specified” codes, the terms are a list of
    the various conditions assigned to that code. The inclusion terms are not
    necessarily exhaustive. Additional terms found only in the Alphabetic Index
    may also be assigned to a code.
  </p>
  <p>12. Excludes Notes</p>
  <p>
    The ICD-10-CM has two types of excludes notes. Each type of note has a
    different definition for use, but they are all similar in that they indicate
    that codes excluded from each other are independent of each other.
  </p>
  <h5>a. Excludes1</h5>
  <p>
    A type 1 Excludes note is a pure excludes note. It means “NOT CODED HERE!”
    An Excludes1 note indicates that the code excluded should never be used at
    the same time as the code above the Excludes1 note. An Excludes1 is used
    when two conditions cannot occur together, such as a congenital form versus
    an acquired form of the same condition.
  </p>
  <p> Page 9 of 115</p>
  <p>
    An exception to the Excludes1 definition is the circumstance when the two
    conditions are unrelated to each other. If it is not clear whether the two
    conditions involving an Excludes1 note are related or not, query the
    provider. For example, code F45.8, Other somatoform disorders, has an
    Excludes1 note for "sleep related teeth grinding (G47.63)," because "teeth
    grinding" is an inclusion term under F45.8. Only one of these two codes
    should be assigned for teeth grinding. However psychogenic dysmenorrhea is
    also an inclusion term under F45.8, and a patient could have both this
    condition and sleep related teeth grinding. In this case, the two conditions
    are clearly unrelated to each other, and so it would be appropriate to
    report F45.8 and G47.63 together.
  </p>
  <h5>b. Excludes2</h5>
  <p>
    A type 2 Excludes note represents “Not included here.” An excludes2 note
    indicates that the condition excluded is not part of the condition
    represented by the code, but a patient may have both conditions at the same
    time. When an Excludes2 note appears under a code, it is acceptable to use
    both the code and the excluded code together, when appropriate.
  </p>
  <p>
    13. Etiology/manifestation convention (“code first”, “use additional code”
    and “in diseases classified elsewhere” notes)
  </p>
  <p>
    Certain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system
    manifestations due to the underlying etiology. For such conditions, the
    ICD-10-CM has a coding convention that requires the underlying condition be
    sequenced first, if applicable, followed by the manifestation. Wherever such
    a combination exists, there is a “use additional code” note at the etiology
    code, and a “code first” note at the manifestation code. These instructional
    notes indicate the proper sequencing order of the codes, etiology followed
    by manifestation.
  </p>
  <p>
    In most cases the manifestation codes will have in the code title, “in
    diseases classified elsewhere.” Codes with this title are a component of the
    etiology/ manifestation convention. The code title indicates that it is a
    manifestation code. “In diseases classified elsewhere” codes are never
    permitted to be used as first listed or principal diagnosis codes. They must
    be used in conjunction with an underlying condition code and they must be
    listed following the underlying condition. See category F02, Dementia in
    other diseases classified elsewhere, for an example of this convention.
    There are manifestation codes that do not have “in diseases classified
    elsewhere” in the title. For such codes, there is a “use additional code”
    note at the etiology code and a “code first” note at the manifestation code,
    and the rules for sequencing apply. In addition to the notes in the Tabular
    List, these conditions also have a specific Alphabetic Index entry
    structure. In the Alphabetic Index both conditions are listed together with
    the etiology code first followed by the manifestation codes in brackets. The
    code in brackets is always to be sequenced second. An example of the
    etiology/manifestation convention is dementia in Parkinson’s disease. In the
    Alphabetic Index, code G20 is listed first, followed by code F02.80 or
    F02.81 in brackets. Code G20 represents the underlying etiology, Parkinson’s
    disease,
  </p>
  <p>Page 10 of 115</p>
  <p>
    and must be sequenced first, whereas code F02.80 and F02.81 represent the
    manifestation of dementia in diseases classified elsewhere, with or without
    behavioral disturbance.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Code first” and “Use additional code” notes are also used as sequencing
    rules in the classification for certain codes that are not part of an
    etiology/ manifestation combination. See Section I.B.7. Multiple coding for
    a single condition.
  </p>
  <p>14. “And”</p>
  <p>
    The word “and” should be interpreted to mean either “and” or “or” when it
    appears in a title.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, cases of “tuberculosis of bones”, “tuberculosis of joints” and
    “tuberculosis of bones and joints” are classified to subcategory A18.0,
    Tuberculosis of bones and joints.
  </p>
  <p>15. “With”</p>
  <p>
    The word “with” or “in” should be interpreted to mean “associated with” or
    “due to” when it appears in a code title, the Alphabetic Index (either under
    a main term or subterm), or an instructional note in the Tabular List. The
    classification presumes a causal relationship between the two conditions
    linked by these terms in the Alphabetic Index or Tabular List. These
    conditions should be coded as related even in the absence of provider
    documentation explicitly linking them, unless the documentation clearly
    states the conditions are unrelated or when another guideline exists that
    specifically requires a documented linkage between two conditions (e.g.,
    sepsis guideline for “acute organ dysfunction that is not clearly associated
    with the sepsis”). For conditions not specifically linked by these
    relational terms in the classification or when a guideline requires that a
    linkage between two conditions be explicitly documented, provider
    documentation must link the conditions in order to code them as related.
  </p>
  <p>
    The word “with” in the Alphabetic Index is sequenced immediately following
    the main term or subterm, not in alphabetical order.
  </p>
  <p>16. “See” and “See Also”</p>
  <p>
    The “see” instruction following a main term in the Alphabetic Index
    indicates that another term should be referenced. It is necessary to go to
    the main term referenced with the “see” note to locate the correct code. A
    “see also” instruction following a main term in the Alphabetic Index
    instructs that there is another main term that may also be referenced that
    may provide additional Alphabetic Index entries that may be useful. It is
    not necessary to follow the “see also” note when the original main term
    provides the necessary code.
  </p>
  <p>Page 11 of 115</p>
  <p>17. “Code also” note</p>
  <p>
    A “code also” note instructs that two codes may be required to fully
    describe a condition, but this note does not provide sequencing direction.
    The sequencing depends on the circumstances of the encounter.
  </p>
  <p>18. Default codes</p>
  <p>
    A code listed next to a main term in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index is
    referred to as a default code. The default code represents that condition
    that is most commonly associated with the main term or is the unspecified
    code for the condition. If a condition is documented in a medical record
    (for example, appendicitis) without any additional information, such as
    acute or chronic, the default code should be assigned.
  </p>
  <p>19. Code assignment and Clinical Criteria</p>
  <p>
    The assignment of a diagnosis code is based on the provider’s diagnostic
    statement that the condition exists. The provider’s statement that the
    patient has a particular condition is sufficient. Code assignment is not
    based on clinical criteria used by the provider to establish the diagnosis.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IB">B. General Coding Guidelines</h4>
  <h4 id="IB01">1. Locating a code in the ICD-10-CM</h4>
  <p>
    To select a code in the classification that corresponds to a diagnosis or
    reason for visit documented in a medical record, first locate the term in
    the Alphabetic Index, and then verify the code in the Tabular List. Read and
    be guided by instructional notations that appear in both the Alphabetic
    Index and the Tabular List. It is essential to use both the Alphabetic Index
    and Tabular List when locating and assigning a code. The Alphabetic Index
    does not always provide the full code. Selection of the full code, including
    laterality and any applicable 7th character can only be done in the Tabular
    List. A dash (-) at the end of an Alphabetic Index entry indicates that
    additional characters are required. Even if a dash is not included at the
    Alphabetic Index entry, it is necessary to refer to the Tabular List to
    verify that no 7th character is required.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IB02">2. Level of Detail in Coding</h4>
  <p>
    Diagnosis codes are to be used and reported at their highest number of
    characters available and to the highest level of specificity documented in
    the medical record. ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes are composed of codes with 3,
    4, 5, 6 or 7 characters. Codes with three characters are included in
    ICD-10-CM as the heading of a category of codes that may be further
    subdivided by the use of fourth and/or fifth characters and/or sixth
    characters, which provide greater detail. A three-character code is to be
    used only if it is not further subdivided. A code is invalid if it has not
    been coded to the full number of characters required for that code,
    including the 7th character, if applicable.
  </p>
  <p>Page 12 of 115</p>
  <h4 id="IB03">3. Code or codes from A00.0 through T88.9, Z00-Z99.8, U00-U85</h4>
  <h4 id="IB04">4. Signs and symptoms</h4>
  <p>
    The appropriate code or codes from A00.0 through T88.9, Z00-Z99.8, and
    U00-U85 must be used to identify diagnoses, symptoms, conditions, problems,
    complaints or other reason(s) for the encounter/visit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Codes that describe symptoms and signs, as opposed to diagnoses, are
    acceptable for reporting purposes when a related definitive diagnosis has
    not been established (confirmed) by the provider. Chapter 18 of ICD-10-CM,
    Symptoms, Signs, and Abnormal Clinical and Laboratory Findings, Not
    Elsewhere Classified (codes R00.0 - R99) contains many, but not all, codes
    for symptoms. See Section I.B.18 Use of Signs/Symptom/Unspecified Codes
  </p>
  <h4 id="IB05">5. Conditions that are an integral part of a disease process</h4>
  <p>
    Signs and symptoms that are associated routinely with a disease process
    should not be assigned as additional codes, unless otherwise instructed by
    the classification.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IB06">6. Conditions that are not an integral part of a disease process</h4>
  <p>
    Additional signs and symptoms that may not be associated routinely with a
    disease process should be coded when present.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IB07">7. Multiple coding for a single condition</h4>
  <p>
    In addition to the etiology/manifestation convention that requires two codes
    to fully describe a single condition that affects multiple body systems,
    there are other single conditions that also require more than one code. “Use
    additional code” notes are found in the Tabular List at codes that are not
    part of an etiology/manifestation pair where a secondary code is useful to
    fully describe a condition. The sequencing rule is the same as the
    etiology/manifestation pair, “use additional code” indicates that a
    secondary code should be added, if known.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, for bacterial infections that are not included in chapter 1, a
    secondary code from category B95, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and
    Enterococcus, as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere, or B96, Other
    bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere, may be
    required to identify the bacterial organism causing the infection. A “use
    additional code” note will normally be found at the infectious disease code,
    indicating a need for the organism code to be added as a secondary code.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Code first” notes are also under certain codes that are not specifically
    manifestation codes but may be due to an underlying cause. When there is a
    “code first” note and an underlying condition is present, the underlying
    condition should be sequenced first, if known.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Code, if applicable, any causal condition first” notes indicate that this
    code may be assigned as a principal diagnosis when the causal condition is
    unknown or not applicable. If a causal condition is known, then the code for
    that condition should be sequenced as the principal or first-listed
    diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>Page 13 of 115</p>
  <p>
    Multiple codes may be needed for sequela, complication codes and obstetric
    codes to more fully describe a condition. See the specific guidelines for
    these conditions for further instruction.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IB08">8. Acute and Chronic Conditions</h4>
  <p>
    If the same condition is described as both acute (subacute) and chronic, and
    separate subentries exist in the Alphabetic Index at the same indentation
    level, code both and sequence the acute (subacute) code first.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IB09">9. Combination Code</h4>
  <p>
    A combination code is a single code used to classify: Two diagnoses, or A
    diagnosis with an associated secondary process (manifestation) A diagnosis
    with an associated complication Combination codes are identified by
    referring to subterm entries in the Alphabetic Index and by reading the
    inclusion and exclusion notes in the Tabular List. Assign only the
    combination code when that code fully identifies the diagnostic conditions
    involved or when the Alphabetic Index so directs. Multiple coding should not
    be used when the classification provides a combination code that clearly
    identifies all of the elements documented in the diagnosis. When the
    combination code lacks necessary specificity in describing the manifestation
    or complication, an additional code should be used as a secondary code.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IB10">10. Sequela (Late Effects)</h4>
  <p>
    A sequela is the residual effect (condition produced) after the acute phase
    of an illness or injury has terminated. There is no time limit on when a
    sequela code can be used. The residual may be apparent early, such as in
    cerebral infarction, or it may occur months or years later, such as that due
    to a previous injury. Examples of sequela include: scar formation resulting
    from a burn, deviated septum due to a nasal fracture, and infertility due to
    tubal occlusion from old tuberculosis. Coding of sequela generally requires
    two codes sequenced in the following order: the condition or nature of the
    sequela is sequenced first. The sequela code is sequenced second. An
    exception to the above guidelines are those instances where the code for the
    sequela is followed by a manifestation code identified in the Tabular List
    and title, or the sequela code has been expanded (at the fourth, fifth or
    sixth character levels) to include the manifestation(s). The code for the
    acute phase of an illness or injury that led to the sequela is never used
    with a code for the late effect. See Section I.C.9. Sequelae of
    cerebrovascular disease See Section I.C.15. Sequelae of complication of
    pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium See Section I.C.19. Application of
    7th characters for Chapter 19
  </p>
  <p> Page 14 of 115</p>
  <h4 id="IB11">11. Impending or Threatened Condition</h4>
  <p>
    Code any condition described at the time of discharge as “impending” or
    “threatened” as follows: If it did occur, code as confirmed diagnosis. If it
    did not occur, reference the Alphabetic Index to determine if the condition
    has a subentry term for “impending” or “threatened” and also reference main
    term entries for “Impending” and for “Threatened.” If the subterms are
    listed, assign the given code. If the subterms are not listed, code the
    existing underlying condition(s) and not the condition described as
    impending or threatened.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IB12">12. Reporting Same Diagnosis Code More than Once</h4>
  <p>
    Each unique ICD-10-CM diagnosis code may be reported only once for an
    encounter. This applies to bilateral conditions when there are no distinct
    codes identifying laterality or two different conditions classified to the
    same ICD-10-CM diagnosis code.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IB13">13. Laterality</h4>
  <p>
    Some ICD-10-CM codes indicate laterality, specifying whether the condition
    occurs on the left, right or is bilateral. If no bilateral code is provided
    and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and
    right side. If the side is not identified in the medical record, assign the
    code for the unspecified side.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a patient has a bilateral condition and each side is treated during
    separate encounters, assign the "bilateral" code (as the condition still
    exists on both sides), including for the encounter to treat the first side.
    For the second encounter for treatment after one side has previously been
    treated and the condition no longer exists on that side, assign the
    appropriate unilateral code for the side where the condition still exists
    (e.g., cataract surgery performed on each eye in separate encounters). The
    bilateral code would not be assigned for the subsequent encounter, as the
    patient no longer has the condition in the previously-treated site. If the
    treatment on the first side did not completely resolve the condition, then
    the bilateral code would still be appropriate. When laterality is not
    documented by the patient’s provider, code assignment for the affected side
    may be based on medical record documentation from other clinicians. If there
    is conflicting medical record documentation regarding the affected side, the
    patient’s attending provider should be queried for clarification. Codes for
    “unspecified” side should rarely be used, such as when the documentation in
    the record is insufficient to determine the affected side and it is not
    possible to obtain clarification.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IB14">14. Documentation by Clinicians Other than the Patient's Provider</h4>
  <p>
    Code assignment is based on the documentation by the patient's provider
    (i.e., physician or other qualified healthcare practitioner legally
    accountable for establishing the patient's diagnosis). There are a few
    exceptions when code assignment may be based on medical record documentation
    from clinicians who are not the patient’s provider (i.e., physician or other
    qualified healthcare practitioner legally accountable for establishing the
    patient’s diagnosis). In this context, “clinicians” other than the patient’s
    provider refer to healthcare professionals permitted, based on regulatory or
  </p>
  <p>Page 15 of 115</p>
  <p>
    accreditation requirements or internal hospital policies, to document in a
    patient’s official medical record. These exceptions include codes for: •
    Body Mass Index (BMI) • Depth of non-pressure chronic ulcers • Pressure
    ulcer stage • Coma scale • NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) • Social determinants of
    health (SDOH) • Laterality • Blood alcohol level
  </p>
  <p>
    This information is typically, or may be, documented by other clinicians
    involved in the care of the patient (e.g., a dietitian often documents the
    BMI, a nurse often documents the pressure ulcer stages, and an emergency
    medical technician often documents the coma scale). However, the associated
    diagnosis (such as overweight, obesity, acute stroke, pressure ulcer, or a
    condition classifiable to category F10, Alcohol related disorders) must be
    documented by the patient’s provider. If there is conflicting medical record
    documentation, either from the same clinician or different clinicians, the
    patient’s attending provider should be queried for clarification. The BMI,
    coma scale, NIHSS, blood alcohol level codes and codes for social
    determinants of health should only be reported as secondary diagnoses. See
    Section I.C.21.c.17 for additional information regarding coding social
    determinants of health.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IB15">15. Syndromes</h4>
  <p>
    Follow the Alphabetic Index guidance when coding syndromes. In the absence
    of Alphabetic Index guidance, assign codes for the documented manifestations
    of the syndrome. Additional codes for manifestations that are not an
    integral part of the disease process may also be assigned when the condition
    does not have a unique code.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IB16">16. Documentation of Complications of Care</h4>
  <p>
    Code assignment is based on the provider’s documentation of the relationship
    between the condition and the care or procedure, unless otherwise instructed
    by the classification. The guideline extends to any complications of care,
    regardless of the chapter the code is located in. It is important to note
    that not all conditions that occur during or following medical care or
    surgery are classified as complications. There must be a cause-and-effect
    relationship between the care provided and the condition, and an indication
    in the documentation that it is a complication. Query the provider for
    clarification, if the complication is not clearly documented.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IB17">17. Borderline Diagnosis</h4>
  <p>
    If the provider documents a "borderline" diagnosis at the time of discharge,
    the diagnosis is coded as confirmed, unless the classification provides a
    specific entry (e.g., borderline diabetes). If a borderline condition has a
    specific index entry in ICD-10-CM,
  </p>
  <p>Page 16 of 115</p>
  <p>
    it should be coded as such. Since borderline conditions are not uncertain
    diagnoses, no distinction is made between the care setting (inpatient versus
    outpatient). Whenever the documentation is unclear regarding a borderline
    condition, coders are encouraged to query for clarification.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IB18">18. Use of Sign/Symptom/Unspecified Codes</h4>
  <p>
    Sign/symptom and “unspecified” codes have acceptable, even necessary, uses.
    While specific diagnosis codes should be reported when they are supported by
    the available medical record documentation and clinical knowledge of the
    patient’s health condition, there are instances when signs/symptoms or
    unspecified codes are the best choices for accurately reflecting the
    healthcare encounter. Each healthcare encounter should be coded to the level
    of certainty known for that encounter. As stated in the introductory section
    of these official coding guidelines, a joint effort between the healthcare
    provider and the coder is essential to achieve complete and accurate
    documentation, code assignment, and reporting of diagnoses and procedures.
    The importance of consistent, complete documentation in the medical record
    cannot be overemphasized. Without such documentation accurate coding cannot
    be achieved. The entire record should be reviewed to determine the specific
    reason for the encounter and the conditions treated.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a definitive diagnosis has not been established by the end of the
    encounter, it is appropriate to report codes for sign(s) and/or symptom(s)
    in lieu of a definitive diagnosis. When sufficient clinical information
    isn’t known or available about a particular health condition to assign a
    more specific code, it is acceptable to report the appropriate “unspecified”
    code (e.g., a diagnosis of pneumonia has been determined, but not the
    specific type). Unspecified codes should be reported when they are the codes
    that most accurately reflect what is known about the patient’s condition at
    the time of that particular encounter. It would be inappropriate to select a
    specific code that is not supported by the medical record documentation or
    conduct medically unnecessary diagnostic testing in order to determine a
    more specific code.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IB19">19. Coding for Healthcare Encounters in Hurricane Aftermath</h4>
  <p>a. Use of External Cause of Morbidity Codes</p>
  <p>
    An external cause of morbidity code should be assigned to identify the cause
    of the injury(ies) incurred as a result of the hurricane. The use of
    external cause of morbidity codes is supplemental to the application of
    ICD-10-CM codes. External cause of morbidity codes are never to be recorded
    as a principal diagnosis (firstlisted in non-inpatient settings). The
    appropriate injury code should be sequenced before any external cause codes.
    The external cause of morbidity codes capture how the injury or health
    condition happened (cause), the intent (unintentional or accidental; or
    intentional, such as suicide or assault), the place where the event
    occurred, the activity of the patient at the time of the event, and the
    person’s status (e.g., civilian, military). They should not be assigned for
    encounters to treat hurricane victims’ medical conditions when no injury,
    adverse effect or poisoning is involved. External cause of morbidity codes
    should be assigned for each encounter for care and treatment of the injury.
    External cause of morbidity codes may be
  </p>
  <p>Page 17 of 115</p>
  <p>
    assigned in all health care settings. For the purpose of capturing complete
    and accurate ICD-10-CM data in the aftermath of the hurricane, a healthcare
    setting should be considered as any location where medical care is provided
    by licensed healthcare professionals.
  </p>
  <p>b. Sequencing of External Causes of Morbidity Codes</p>
  <p>
    Codes for cataclysmic events, such as a hurricane, take priority over all
    other external cause codes except child and adult abuse and terrorism and
    should be sequenced before other external cause of injury codes. Assign as
    many external cause of morbidity codes as necessary to fully explain each
    cause. For example, if an injury occurs as a result of a building collapse
    during the hurricane, external cause codes for both the hurricane and the
    building collapse should be assigned, with the external causes code for
    hurricane being sequenced as the first external cause code. For injuries
    incurred as a direct result of the hurricane, assign the appropriate code(s)
    for the injuries, followed by the code X37.0-, Hurricane (with the
    appropriate 7th character), and any other applicable external cause of
    injury codes. Code X37.0- also should be assigned when an injury is incurred
    as a result of flooding caused by a levee breaking related to the hurricane.
    Code X38.-, Flood (with the appropriate 7th character), should be assigned
    when an injury is from flooding resulting directly from the storm. Code
    X36.0.-, Collapse of dam or manmade structure, should not be assigned when
    the cause of the collapse is due to the hurricane. Use of code X36.0- is
    limited to collapses of man-made structures due to earth surface movements,
    not due to storm surges directly from a hurricane.
  </p>
  <p>c. Other External Causes of Morbidity Code Issues</p>
  <p>
    For injuries that are not a direct result of the hurricane, such as an
    evacuee that has incurred an injury as a result of a motor vehicle accident,
    assign the appropriate external cause of morbidity code(s) to describe the
    cause of the injury, but do not assign code X37.0-, Hurricane. If it is not
    clear whether the injury was a direct result of the hurricane, assume the
    injury is due to the hurricane and assign code X37.0-, Hurricane, as well as
    any other applicable external cause of morbidity codes. In addition to code
    X37.0-, Hurricane, other possible applicable external cause of morbidity
    codes include: X30-, Exposure to excessive natural heat X31-, Exposure to
    excessive natural cold X38-, Flood
  </p>
  <p>d. Use of Z codes</p>
  <p>
    Z codes (other reasons for healthcare encounters) may be assigned as
    appropriate to further explain the reasons for presenting for healthcare
    services, including transfers between healthcare facilities, or provide
    additional information relevant to a patient encounter. The ICD-10-CM
    Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting identify which codes maybe
    assigned as principal or first-listed diagnosis only, secondary diagnosis
    only, or principal/first-listed or secondary (depending on the
    circumstances). Possible applicable Z codes include: Z59.0-, Homelessness
  </p>
  <p>Page 18 of 115</p>
  <p>
    Z59.1, Inadequate housing Z59.5, Extreme poverty Z75.1, Person awaiting
    admission to adequate facility elsewhere Z75.3, Unavailability and
    inaccessibility of health-care facilities Z75.4, Unavailability and
    inaccessibility of other helping agencies Z76.2, Encounter for health
    supervision and care of other healthy infant and child Z99.12, Encounter for
    respirator [ventilator] dependence during power failure The external cause
    of morbidity codes and the Z codes listed above are not an all-inclusive
    list. Other codes may be applicable to the encounter based upon the
    documentation. Assign as many codes as necessary to fully explain each
    healthcare encounter. Since patient history information may be very limited,
    use any available documentation to assign the appropriate external cause of
    morbidity and Z codes.
  </p>
  <h3 id="IC">C. Chapter-Specific Coding Guidelines</h3>
  <p>
    In addition to general coding guidelines, there are guidelines for specific
    diagnoses and/or conditions in the classification. Unless otherwise
    indicated, these guidelines apply to all health care settings. Please refer
    to Section II for guidelines on the selection of principal diagnosis.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IC01">
    1. Chapter 1: Certain Infectious and Parasitic Diseases (A00-B99), U07.1, U09.9
  </h4>
  <p>a. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infections</p>
  <p>1) Code only confirmed cases</p>
  <p>
    Code only confirmed cases of HIV infection/illness. This is an exception to
    the hospital inpatient guideline Section II, H. In this context,
    “confirmation” does not require documentation of positive serology or
    culture for HIV; the provider’s diagnostic statement that the patient is HIV
    positive or has an HIV-related illness is sufficient.
  </p>
  <p>2) Selection and sequencing of HIV codes</p>
  <p>(a) Patient admitted for HIV-related condition</p>
  <p>
    If a patient is admitted for an HIV-related condition, the principal
    diagnosis should be B20, Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease followed
    by additional diagnosis codes for all reported HIV-related conditions.
  </p>
  <p>(b) Patient with HIV disease admitted for unrelated condition</p>
  <p>
    If a patient with HIV disease is admitted for an unrelated condition (such
    as a traumatic injury), the code for the unrelated condition (e.g., the
    nature of injury code) should be the principal
  </p>
  <p> Page 19 of 115</p>
  <p>
    diagnosis. Other diagnoses would be B20 followed by additional diagnosis
    codes for all reported HIV-related conditions.
  </p>
  <p>(c) Whether the patient is newly diagnosed</p>
  <p>
    Whether the patient is newly diagnosed or has had previous
    admissions/encounters for HIV conditions is irrelevant to the sequencing
    decision.
  </p>
  <p>(d) Asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus</p>
  <p>
    Z21, Asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection status, is to
    be applied when the patient without any documentation of symptoms is listed
    as being “HIV positive,” “known HIV,” “HIV test positive,” or similar
    terminology. Do not use this code if the term “AIDS” or “HIV disease” is
    used or if the patient is treated for any HIV-related illness or is
    described as having any condition(s) resulting from his/her HIV positive
    status; use B20 in these cases.
  </p>
  <p>(e) Patients with inconclusive HIV serology</p>
  <p>
    Patients with inconclusive HIV serology, but no definitive diagnosis or
    manifestations of the illness, may be assigned code R75, Inconclusive
    laboratory evidence of human immunodeficiency virus [HIV].
  </p>
  <p>(f) Previously diagnosed HIV-related illness</p>
  <p>
    Patients with any known prior diagnosis of an HIV-related illness should be
    coded to B20. Once a patient has developed an HIV-related illness, the
    patient should always be assigned code B20 on every subsequent
    admission/encounter. Patients previously diagnosed with any HIV illness
    (B20) should never be assigned to R75 or Z21, Asymptomatic human
    immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection status.
  </p>
  <p>(g) HIV Infection in Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Puerperium</p>
  <p>
    During pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium, a patient admitted (or
    presenting for a health care encounter) because of an HIV-related illness
    should receive a principal diagnosis code of O98.7-, Human immunodeficiency
    [HIV] disease complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium,
    followed by B20 and the code(s) for the HIV-related illness(es). Codes from
    Chapter 15 always take sequencing priority.
  </p>
  <p>
    Patients with asymptomatic HIV infection status admitted (or presenting for
    a health care encounter) during pregnancy, childbirth, or the puerperium
    should receive codes of O98.7- and Z21.
  </p>
  <p> Page 20 of 115</p>
  <p>(h) Encounters for testing for HIV</p>
  <p>
    If a patient is being seen to determine his/her HIV status, use code Z11.4,
    Encounter for screening for human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]. Use
    additional codes for any associated high-risk behavior, if applicable. If a
    patient with signs or symptoms is being seen for HIV testing, code the signs
    and symptoms. An additional counseling code Z71.7, Human immunodeficiency
    virus [HIV] counseling, may be used if counseling is provided during the
    encounter for the test.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a patient returns to be informed of his/her HIV test results and the
    test result is negative, use code Z71.7, Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]
    counseling. If the results are positive, see previous guidelines and assign
    codes as appropriate.
  </p>
  <p>(i) History of HIV managed by medication</p>
  <p>
    If a patient with documented history of HIV disease is currently managed on
    antiretroviral medications, assign code B20, Human immunodeficiency virus
    [HIV] disease. Code Z79.899, Other long term (current) drug therapy, may be
    assigned as an additional code to identify the long-term (current) use of
    antiretroviral medications.
  </p>
  <p>
    b. Infectious agents as the cause of diseases classified to other chapters
  </p>
  <p>
    Certain infections are classified in chapters other than Chapter 1 and no
    organism is identified as part of the infection code. In these instances, it
    is necessary to use an additional code from Chapter 1 to identify the
    organism. A code from category B95, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and
    Enterococcus as the cause of diseases classified to other chapters, B96,
    Other bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified to other
    chapters, or B97, Viral agents as the cause of diseases classified to other
    chapters, is to be used as an additional code to identify the organism. An
    instructional note will be found at the infection code advising that an
    additional organism code is required.
  </p>
  <p>c. Infections resistant to antibiotics</p>
  <p>
    Many bacterial infections are resistant to current antibiotics. It is
    necessary to identify all infections documented as antibiotic resistant.
    Assign a code from category Z16, Resistance to antimicrobial drugs,
    following the infection code only if the infection code does not identify
    drug resistance.
  </p>
  <p> Page 21 of 115</p>
  <p>
    d. Sepsis, Severe Sepsis, and Septic Shock Infections resistant to
    antibiotics 1) Coding of Sepsis and Severe Sepsis
  </p>
  <p>(a) Sepsis</p>
  <p>
    For a diagnosis of sepsis, assign the appropriate code for the underlying
    systemic infection. If the type of infection or causal organism is not
    further specified, assign code A41.9, Sepsis, unspecified organism.
  </p>
  <p>
    A code from subcategory R65.2, Severe sepsis, should not be assigned unless
    severe sepsis or an associated acute organ dysfunction is documented.
  </p>
  <p>
    (i) Negative or inconclusive blood cultures and sepsis Negative or
    inconclusive blood cultures do not preclude a diagnosis of sepsis in
    patients with clinical evidence of the condition; however, the provider
    should be queried.
  </p>
  <p>(ii) Urosepsis</p>
  <p>
    The term urosepsis is a nonspecific term. It is not to be considered
    synonymous with sepsis. It has no default code in the Alphabetic Index.
    Should a provider use this term, he/she must be queried for clarification.
  </p>
  <p>(iii)Sepsis with organ dysfunction</p>
  <p>
    If a patient has sepsis and associated acute organ dysfunction or multiple
    organ dysfunction (MOD), follow the instructions for coding severe sepsis.
  </p>
  <p>
    (iv) Acute organ dysfunction that is not clearly associated with the sepsis
  </p>
  <p>
    If a patient has sepsis and an acute organ dysfunction, but the medical
    record documentation indicates that the acute organ dysfunction is related
    to a medical condition other than the sepsis, do not assign a code from
    subcategory R65.2, Severe sepsis. An acute organ dysfunction must be
    associated with the sepsis in order to assign the severe sepsis code. If the
    documentation is not clear as to whether an acute organ dysfunction is
    related to the sepsis or another medical condition, query the provider.
  </p>
  <p>(b) Severe sepsis</p>
  <p>
    The coding of severe sepsis requires a minimum of 2 codes: first a code for
    the underlying systemic infection, followed by a code from subcategory
    R65.2, Severe sepsis. If the causal organism is
  </p>
  <p>Page 22 of 115</p>
  <p>
    not documented, assign code A41.9, Sepsis, unspecified organism, for the
    infection. Additional code(s) for the associated acute organ dysfunction are
    also required. Due to the complex nature of severe sepsis, some cases may
    require querying the provider prior to assignment of the codes.
  </p>
  <p>2) Septic shock</p>
  <p>
    Septic shock generally refers to circulatory failure associated with severe
    sepsis, and therefore, it represents a type of acute organ dysfunction. For
    cases of septic shock, the code for the systemic infection should be
    sequenced first, followed by code R65.21, Severe sepsis with septic shock or
    code T81.12, Postprocedural septic shock. Any additional codes for the other
    acute organ dysfunctions should also be assigned. As noted in the sequencing
    instructions in the Tabular List, the code for septic shock cannot be
    assigned as a principal diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>3) Sequencing of severe sepsis</p>
  <p>
    If severe sepsis is present on admission, and meets the definition of
    principal diagnosis, the underlying systemic infection should be assigned as
    principal diagnosis followed by the appropriate code from subcategory R65.2
    as required by the sequencing rules in the Tabular List. A code from
    subcategory R65.2 can never be assigned as a principal diagnosis. When
    severe sepsis develops during an encounter (it was not present on
    admission), the underlying systemic infection and the appropriate code from
    subcategory R65.2 should be assigned as secondary diagnoses. Severe sepsis
    may be present on admission, but the diagnosis may not be confirmed until
    sometime after admission. If the documentation is not clear whether severe
    sepsis was present on admission, the provider should be queried.
  </p>
  <p>4) Sepsis or severe sepsis with a localized infection</p>
  <p>
    If the reason for admission is sepsis or severe sepsis and a localized
    infection, such as pneumonia or cellulitis, a code(s) for the underlying
    systemic infection should be assigned first and the code for the localized
    infection should be assigned as a secondary diagnosis. If the patient has
    severe sepsis, a code from subcategory R65.2 should also be assigned as a
    secondary diagnosis. If the patient is admitted with a localized infection,
    such as pneumonia, and sepsis/severe sepsis doesn’t develop until after
    admission, the localized infection should be assigned first, followed by the
    appropriate sepsis/severe sepsis codes.
  </p>
  <p>5) Sepsis due to a postprocedural infection</p>
  <p>(a) Documentation of causal relationship</p>
  <p>Page 23 of 115</p>
  <p>
    As with all postprocedural complications, code assignment is based on the
    provider’s documentation of the relationship between the infection and the
    procedure.
  </p>
  <p>(b) Sepsis due to a postprocedural infection</p>
  <p>
    For infections following a procedure, a code from T81.40, to T81.43
    Infection following a procedure, or a code from O86.00 to O86.03, Infection
    of obstetric surgical wound, that identifies the site of the infection
    should be coded first, if known. Assign an additional code for sepsis
    following a procedure (T81.44) or sepsis following an obstetrical procedure
    (O86.04). Use an additional code to identify the infectious agent. If the
    patient has severe sepsis, the appropriate code from subcategory R65.2
    should also be assigned with the additional code(s) for any acute organ
    dysfunction.
  </p>
  <p>
    For infections following infusion, transfusion, therapeutic injection, or
    immunization, a code from subcategory T80.2, Infections following infusion,
    transfusion, and therapeutic injection, or code T88.0-, Infection following
    immunization, should be coded first, followed by the code for the specific
    infection. If the patient has severe sepsis, the appropriate code from
    subcategory R65.2 should also be assigned, with the additional codes(s) for
    any acute organ dysfunction.
  </p>
  <p>(c) Postprocedural infection and postprocedural septic shock</p>
  <p>
    If a postprocedural infection has resulted in postprocedural septic shock,
    assign the codes indicated above for sepsis due to a postprocedural
    infection, followed by code T81.12-, Postprocedural septic shock. Do not
    assign code R65.21, Severe sepsis with septic shock. Additional code(s)
    should be assigned for any acute organ dysfunction.
  </p>
  <p>
    6) Sepsis and severe sepsis associated with a noninfectious process
    (condition)
  </p>
  <p>
    In some cases, a noninfectious process (condition) such as trauma, may lead
    to an infection which can result in sepsis or severe sepsis. If sepsis or
    severe sepsis is documented as associated with a noninfectious condition,
    such as a burn or serious injury, and this condition meets the definition
    for principal diagnosis, the code for the noninfectious condition should be
    sequenced first, followed by the code for the resulting infection. If severe
    sepsis is present, a code from subcategory R65.2 should also be assigned
    with any associated organ dysfunction(s) codes. It is not necessary to
    assign a code from subcategory R65.1, Systemic inflammatory response
    syndrome (SIRS) of non-infectious origin, for these cases.
  </p>
  <p> Page 24 of 115</p>
  <p>
    If the infection meets the definition of principal diagnosis, it should be
    sequenced before the non-infectious condition. When both the associated
    non-infectious condition and the infection meet the definition of principal
    diagnosis, either may be assigned as principal diagnosis. Only one code from
    category R65, Symptoms and signs specifically associated with systemic
    inflammation and infection, should be assigned. Therefore, when a
    non-infectious condition leads to an infection resulting in severe sepsis,
    assign the appropriate code from subcategory R65.2, Severe sepsis. Do not
    additionally assign a code from subcategory R65.1, Systemic inflammatory
    response syndrome (SIRS) of noninfectious origin. See Section I.C.18. SIRS
    due to non-infectious process
  </p>
  <p>
    7) Sepsis and septic shock complicating abortion, pregnancy, childbirth, and
    the puerperium
  </p>
  <p>
    See Section I.C.15. Sepsis and septic shock complicating abortion,
    pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium
  </p>
  <p>8) Newborn sepsis</p>
  <p>See Section I.C.16. f. Bacterial sepsis of Newborn</p>
  <p>e. Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Conditions</p>
  <p>1) Selection and sequencing of MRSA codes</p>
  <p>(a) Combination codes for MRSA infection</p>
  <p>
    When a patient is diagnosed with an infection that is due to methicillin
    resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and that infection has a combination
    code that includes the causal organism (e.g., sepsis, pneumonia) assign the
    appropriate combination code for the condition (e.g., code A41.02, Sepsis
    due to Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus or code J15.212,
    Pneumonia due to Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Do not assign
    code B95.62, Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection as the
    cause of diseases classified elsewhere, as an additional code, because the
    combination code includes the type of infection and the MRSA organism. Do
    not assign a code from subcategory Z16.11, Resistance to penicillins, as an
    additional diagnosis. See Section C.1. for instructions on coding and
    sequencing of sepsis and severe sepsis.
  </p>
  <p>(b) Other codes for MRSA infection</p>
  <p>
    When there is documentation of a current infection (e.g., wound infection,
    stitch abscess, urinary tract infection) due to MRSA, and
  </p>
  <p>Page 25 of 115</p>
  <p>
    that infection does not have a combination code that includes the causal
    organism, assign the appropriate code to identify the condition along with
    code B95.62, Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection as the
    cause of diseases classified elsewhere for the MRSA infection. Do not assign
    a code from subcategory Z16.11, Resistance to penicillins.
  </p>
  <p>
    (c) Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and MRSA
    colonization
  </p>
  <p>
    The condition or state of being colonized or carrying MSSA or MRSA is called
    colonization or carriage, while an individual person is described as being
    colonized or being a carrier. Colonization means that MSSA or MSRA is
    present on or in the body without necessarily causing illness. A positive
    MRSA colonization test might be documented by the provider as “MRSA screen
    positive” or “MRSA nasal swab positive”. Assign code Z22.322, Carrier or
    suspected carrier of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, for
    patients documented as having MRSA colonization. Assign code Z22.321,
    Carrier or suspected carrier of Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus
    aureus, for patients documented as having MSSA colonization. Colonization is
    not necessarily indicative of a disease process or as the cause of a
    specific condition the patient may have unless documented as such by the
    provider.
  </p>
  <p>(d) MRSA colonization and infection</p>
  <p>
    If a patient is documented as having both MRSA colonization and infection
    during a hospital admission, code Z22.322, Carrier or suspected carrier of
    Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and a code for the MRSA
    infection may both be assigned.
  </p>
  <p>f. Zika virus infections</p>
  <p>1) Code only confirmed cases</p>
  <p>
    Code only a confirmed diagnosis of Zika virus (A92.5, Zika virus disease) as
    documented by the provider. This is an exception to the hospital inpatient
    guideline Section II, H. In this context, “confirmation” does not require
    documentation of the type of test performed; the provider’s diagnostic
    statement that the condition is confirmed is sufficient. This code should be
    assigned regardless of the stated mode of transmission.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the provider documents "suspected", "possible" or "probable" Zika, do not
    assign code A92.5. Assign a code(s) explaining the reason for encounter
    (such as fever, rash, or joint pain) or Z20.821, Contact with and
    (suspected) exposure to Zika virus.
  </p>
  <p>Page 26 of 115</p>
  <p>g. Coronavirus infections</p>
  <p>1) COVID-19 infection (infection due to SARS-CoV-2)</p>
  <p>(a) Code only confirmed cases</p>
  <p>
    Code only a confirmed diagnosis of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease
    (COVID-19) as documented by the provider, or documentation of a positive
    COVID-19 test result. For a confirmed diagnosis, assign code U07.1,
    COVID-19. This is an exception to the hospital inpatient guideline Section
    II, H. In this context, “confirmation” does not require documentation of a
    positive test result for COVID-19; the provider’s documentation that the
    individual has COVID-19 is sufficient. If the provider documents
    "suspected," "possible," "probable," or “inconclusive” COVID-19, do not
    assign code U07.1. Instead, code the signs and symptoms reported. See
    guideline I.C.1.g.1.g.
  </p>
  <p>(b) Sequencing of codes</p>
  <p>
    When COVID-19 meets the definition of principal diagnosis, code U07.1,
    COVID-19, should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate codes for
    associated manifestations, except when another guideline requires that
    certain codes be sequenced first, such as obstetrics, sepsis, or transplant
    complications. For a COVID-19 infection that progresses to sepsis, see
    Section I.C.1.d. Sepsis, Severe Sepsis, and Septic Shock See Section
    I.C.15.s. for COVID-19 infection in pregnancy, childbirth, and the
    puerperium See Section I.C.16.h. for COVID-19 infection in newborn For a
    COVID-19 infection in a lung transplant patient, see Section I.C.19.g.3.a.
    Transplant complications other than kidney.
  </p>
  <p>(c) Acute respiratory manifestations of COVID-19</p>
  <p>
    When the reason for the encounter/admission is a respiratory manifestation
    of COVID-19, assign code U07.1, COVID-19, as the principal/first-listed
    diagnosis and assign code(s) for the respiratory manifestation(s) as
    additional diagnoses. The following conditions are examples of common
    respiratory manifestations of COVID-19.
  </p>
  <p>(i) Pneumonia</p>
  <p>Page 27 of 115</p>
  <p>
    For a patient with pneumonia confirmed as due to COVID-19, assign codes
    U07.1, COVID-19, and J12.82, Pneumonia due to coronavirus disease 2019.
  </p>
  <p>(ii) Acute bronchitis</p>
  <p>
    For a patient with acute bronchitis confirmed as due to COVID-19, assign
    codes U07.1, and J20.8, Acute bronchitis due to other specified organisms.
    Bronchitis not otherwise specified (NOS) due to COVID19 should be coded
    using code U07.1 and J40, Bronchitis, not specified as acute or chronic.
  </p>
  <p>(iii)Lower respiratory infection</p>
  <p>
    If the COVID-19 is documented as being associated with a lower respiratory
    infection, not otherwise specified (NOS), or an acute respiratory infection,
    NOS, codes U07.1 and J22, Unspecified acute lower respiratory infection,
    should be assigned.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the COVID-19 is documented as being associated with a respiratory
    infection, NOS, codes U07.1 and J98.8, Other specified respiratory
    disorders, should be assigned.
  </p>
  <p>(iv) Acute respiratory distress syndrome</p>
  <p>
    For acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19, assign codes
    U07.1, and J80, Acute respiratory distress syndrome.
  </p>
  <p>(v) Acute respiratory failure</p>
  <p>
    For acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19, assign code U07.1, and code
    J96.0-, Acute respiratory failure.
  </p>
  <p>(d) Non-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19</p>
  <p>
    When the reason for the encounter/admission is a non-respiratory
    manifestation (e.g., viral enteritis) of COVID-19, assign code U07.1,
    COVID-19, as the principal/first-listed diagnosis and assign code(s) for the
    manifestation(s) as additional diagnoses.
  </p>
  <p>(e) Exposure to COVID-19</p>
  <p>
    For asymptomatic individuals with actual or suspected exposure to COVID-19,
    assign code Z20.822, Contact with and (suspected) exposure to COVID-19.
  </p>
  <p>
    For symptomatic individuals with actual or suspected exposure to COVID-19
    and the infection has been ruled out, or test results are inconclusive or
    unknown, assign code Z20.822, Contact with and (suspected) exposure to
    COVID-19. See guideline
  </p>
  <p>Page 28 of 115</p>
  <p>
    I.C.21.c.1, Contact/Exposure, for additional guidance regarding the use of
    category Z20 codes. If COVID-19 is confirmed, see guideline I.C.1.g.1.a.
  </p>
  <p>(f) Screening for COVID-19</p>
  <p>
    During the COVID-19 pandemic, a screening code is generally not appropriate.
    Do not assign code Z11.52, Encounter for screening for COVID-19. For
    encounters for COVID-19 testing, including preoperative testing, code as
    exposure to COVID-19 (guideline I.C.1.g.1.e). Coding guidance will be
    updated as new information concerning any changes in the pandemic status
    becomes available.
  </p>
  <p>(g) Signs and symptoms without definitive diagnosis of COVID19</p>
  <p>
    For patients presenting with any signs/symptoms associated with COVID-19
    (such as fever, etc.) but a definitive diagnosis has not been established,
    assign the appropriate code(s) for each of the presenting signs and symptoms
    such as: • R05.1, Acute cough, or R05.9, Cough, unspecified • R06.02
    Shortness of breath • R50.9 Fever, unspecified
  </p>
  <p>
    If a patient with signs/symptoms associated with COVID-19 also has an actual
    or suspected contact with or exposure to COVID-19, assign Z20.822, Contact
    with and (suspected) exposure to COVID-19, as an additional code.
  </p>
  <p>(h) Asymptomatic individuals who test positive for COVID-19</p>
  <p>
    For asymptomatic individuals who test positive for COVID-19, see guideline
    I.C.1.g.1.a. Although the individual is asymptomatic, the individual has
    tested positive and is considered to have the COVID-19 infection.
  </p>
  <p>(i) Personal history of COVID-19</p>
  <p>
    For patients with a history of COVID-19, assign code Z86.16, Personal
    history of COVID-19.
  </p>
  <p>(j) Follow-up visits after COVID-19 infection has resolved</p>
  <p>
    For individuals who previously had COVID-19, without residual symptom(s) or
    condition(s), and are being seen for follow-up evaluation, and COVID-19 test
    results are negative, assign codes Z09, Encounter for follow-up examination
    after completed treatment for conditions other than malignant neoplasm, and
    Z86.16, Personal history of COVID-19.
  </p>
  <p> Page 29 of 115</p>
  <p>
    For follow-up visits for individuals with symptom(s) or condition(s) related
    to a previous COVID-19 infection, see guideline I.C.1.g.1.m. See Section
    I.C.21.c.8, Factors influencing health states and contact with health
    services, Follow-up (k) Encounter for antibody testing
  </p>
  <p>
    For an encounter for antibody testing that is not being performed to confirm
    a current COVID-19 infection, nor is a follow-up test after resolution of
    COVID-19, assign Z01.84, Encounter for antibody response examination. Follow
    the applicable guidelines above if the individual is being tested to confirm
    a current COVID-19 infection. For follow-up testing after a COVID-19
    infection, see guideline I.C.1.g.1.j.
  </p>
  <p>(l) Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome</p>
  <p>
    For individuals with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) and COVID-19,
    assign code U07.1, COVID-19, as the principal/first-listed diagnosis and
    assign code M35.81, Multisystem inflammatory syndrome, as an additional
    diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    If an individual with a history of COVID-19 develops MIS, assign codes
    M35.81, Multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and U09.9, Post COVID-19
    condition, unspecified.
  </p>
  <p>
    If an individual with a known or suspected exposure to COVID19, and no
    current COVID-19 infection or history of COVID-19, develops MIS, assign
    codes M35.81, Multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and Z20.822, Contact with
    and (suspected) exposure to COVID-19. Additional codes should be assigned
    for any associated complications of MIS.
  </p>
  <p>(m) Post COVID-19 Condition</p>
  <p>
    For sequela of COVID-19, or associated symptoms or conditions that develop
    following a previous COVID-19 infection, assign a code(s) for the specific
    symptom(s) or condition(s) related to the previous COVID-19 infection, if
    known, and code U09.9, Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified.
  </p>
  <p>
    Code U09.9 should not be assigned for manifestations of an active (current)
    COVID-19 infection.
  </p>
  <p>Page 30 of 115</p>
  <p>
    If a patient has a condition(s) associated with a previous COVID-19
    infection and develops a new active (current) COVID-19 infection, code U09.9
    may be assigned in conjunction with code U07.1, COVID-19, to identify that
    the patient also has a condition(s) associated with a previous COVID-19
    infection. Code(s) for the specific condition(s) associated with the
    previous COVID-19 infection and code(s) for manifestation(s) of the new
    active (current) COVID-19 infection should also be assigned.
  </p>
  <p>(n) Underimmunization for COVID-19 Status</p>
  <p>
    Code Z18.310, Unvaccinated for COVID-19, may be assigned when the patient
    has not received at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine. Code Z28.311,
    Partially vaccinated for COVID-19, may be assigned when the patient has
    received at least one dose of a multi-dose COVID-19 vaccine regimen, but has
    not received the full set of doses necessary to meet the Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention (CDC) definition of “fully vaccinated” in place at
    the time of the encounter. For information, visit the CDC’s website
    https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019ncov/vaccines/.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IC02">2. Chapter 2: Neoplasms (C00-D49)</h4>
  <p>General Guidelines</p>
  <p>
    Chapter 2 of the ICD-10-CM contains the codes for most benign and all
    malignant neoplasms. Certain benign neoplasms, such as prostatic adenomas,
    may be found in the specific body system chapters. To properly code a
    neoplasm, it is necessary to determine from the record if the neoplasm is
    benign, in-situ, malignant, or of uncertain histologic behavior. If
    malignant, any secondary (metastatic) sites should also be determined.
  </p>
  <p>Primary malignant neoplasms overlapping site boundaries</p>
  <p>
    A primary malignant neoplasm that overlaps two or more contiguous (next to
    each other) sites should be classified to the subcategory/code .8
    ('overlapping lesion'), unless the combination is specifically indexed
    elsewhere. For multiple neoplasms of the same site that are not contiguous
    such as tumors in different quadrants of the same breast, codes for each
    site should be assigned.
  </p>
  <p>Malignant neoplasm of ectopic tissue</p>
  <p>
    Malignant neoplasms of ectopic tissue are to be coded to the site of origin
    mentioned, e.g., ectopic pancreatic malignant neoplasms involving the
    stomach are coded to malignant neoplasm of pancreas, unspecified (C25.9).
    The neoplasm table in the Alphabetic Index should be referenced first.
    However, if the histological term is documented, that term should be
    referenced first, rather than going
  </p>
  <p>Page 31 of 115</p>
  <p>
    immediately to the Neoplasm Table, in order to determine which column in the
    Neoplasm Table is appropriate. For example, if the documentation indicates
    “adenoma,” refer to the term in the Alphabetic Index to review the entries
    under this term and the instructional note to “see also neoplasm, by site,
    benign.” The table provides the proper code based on the type of neoplasm
    and the site. It is important to select the proper column in the table that
    corresponds to the type of neoplasm. The Tabular List should then be
    referenced to verify that the correct code has been selected from the table
    and that a more specific site code does not exist.
  </p>
  <p>
    See Section I.C.21. Factors influencing health status and contact with
    health services, Status, for information regarding Z15.0, codes for genetic
    susceptibility to cancer.
  </p>
  <p>a. Treatment directed at the malignancy</p>
  <p>
    If the treatment is directed at the malignancy, designate the malignancy as
    the principal diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    The only exception to this guideline is if a patient admission/encounter is
    solely for the administration of chemotherapy, immunotherapy or external
    beam radiation therapy, assign the appropriate Z51.-- code as the
    first-listed or principal diagnosis, and the diagnosis or problem for which
    the service is being performed as a secondary diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>b. Treatment of secondary site</p>
  <p>
    When a patient is admitted because of a primary neoplasm with metastasis and
    treatment is directed toward the secondary site only, the secondary neoplasm
    is designated as the principal diagnosis even though the primary malignancy
    is still present.
  </p>
  <p>c. Coding and sequencing of complications</p>
  <p>
    Coding and sequencing of complications associated with the malignancies or
    with the therapy thereof are subject to the following guidelines:
  </p>
  <p>1) Anemia associated with malignancy</p>
  <p>
    When admission/encounter is for management of an anemia associated with the
    malignancy, and the treatment is only for anemia, the appropriate code for
    the malignancy is sequenced as the principal or first-listed diagnosis
    followed by the appropriate code for the anemia (such as code D63.0, Anemia
    in neoplastic disease).
  </p>
  <p>
    2) Anemia associated with chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiation therapy
  </p>
  <p>
    When the admission/encounter is for management of an anemia associated with
    an adverse effect of the administration of chemotherapy or immunotherapy and
    the only treatment is for the anemia, the anemia code is sequenced first
    followed by the appropriate codes for the neoplasm and the adverse effect
    (T45.1X5-, Adverse effect of antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs).
  </p>
  <p>Page 32 of 115</p>
  <p>
    When the admission/encounter is for management of an anemia associated with
    an adverse effect of radiotherapy, the anemia code should be sequenced
    first, followed by the appropriate neoplasm code and code Y84.2,
    Radiological procedure and radiotherapy as the cause of abnormal reaction of
    the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at
    the time of the procedure.
  </p>
  <p>3) Management of dehydration due to the malignancy</p>
  <p>
    When the admission/encounter is for management of dehydration due to the
    malignancy and only the dehydration is being treated (intravenous
    rehydration), the dehydration is sequenced first, followed by the code(s)
    for the malignancy.
  </p>
  <p>4) Treatment of a complication resulting from a surgical procedure</p>
  <p>
    When the admission/encounter is for treatment of a complication resulting
    from a surgical procedure, designate the complication as the principal or
    first-listed diagnosis if treatment is directed at resolving the
    complication.
  </p>
  <p>d. Primary malignancy previously excised</p>
  <p>
    When a primary malignancy has been previously excised or eradicated from its
    site and there is no further treatment directed to that site and there is no
    evidence of any existing primary malignancy at that site, a code from
    category Z85, Personal history of malignant neoplasm, should be used to
    indicate the former site of the malignancy. Any mention of extension,
    invasion, or metastasis to another site is coded as a secondary malignant
    neoplasm to that site. The secondary site may be the principal or
    first-listed diagnosis with the Z85 code used as a secondary code.
  </p>
  <p>
    e. Admissions/Encounters involving chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiation
    therapy
  </p>
  <p>1) Episode of care involves surgical removal of neoplasm</p>
  <p>
    When an episode of care involves the surgical removal of a neoplasm, primary
    or secondary site, followed by adjunct chemotherapy or radiation treatment
    during the same episode of care, the code for the neoplasm should be
    assigned as principal or first-listed diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    2) Patient admission/encounter solely for administration of chemotherapy,
    immunotherapy and radiation therapy
  </p>
  <p>
    If a patient admission/encounter is solely for the administration of
    chemotherapy, immunotherapy or external beam radiation therapy assign code
    Z51.0, Encounter for antineoplastic radiation therapy, or Z51.11, Encounter
    for antineoplastic chemotherapy, or Z51.12, Encounter for antineoplastic
    immunotherapy as the first-listed or principal diagnosis. If a patient
    receives more than one of these therapies during the same
  </p>
  <p>Page 33 of 115</p>
  <p>
    admission more than one of these codes may be assigned, in any sequence.
  </p>
  <p>
    The malignancy for which the therapy is being administered should be
    assigned as a secondary diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a patient admission/encounter is for the insertion or implantation of
    radioactive elements (e.g., brachytherapy) the appropriate code for the
    malignancy is sequenced as the principal or first-listed diagnosis. Code
    Z51.0 should not be assigned.
  </p>
  <p>
    3) Patient admitted for radiation therapy, chemotherapy or immunotherapy and
    develops complications
  </p>
  <p>
    When a patient is admitted for the purpose of external beam radiotherapy,
    immunotherapy or chemotherapy and develops complications such as
    uncontrolled nausea and vomiting or dehydration, the principal or
    first-listed diagnosis is Z51.0, Encounter for antineoplastic radiation
    therapy, or Z51.11, Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy, or Z51.12,
    Encounter for antineoplastic immunotherapy followed by any codes for the
    complications.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a patient is admitted for the purpose of insertion or implantation of
    radioactive elements (e.g., brachytherapy) and develops complications such
    as uncontrolled nausea and vomiting or dehydration, the principal or
    first-listed diagnosis is the appropriate code for the malignancy followed
    by any codes for the complications.
  </p>
  <p>f. Admission/encounter to determine extent of malignancy</p>
  <p>
    When the reason for admission/encounter is to determine the extent of the
    malignancy, or for a procedure such as paracentesis or thoracentesis, the
    primary malignancy or appropriate metastatic site is designated as the
    principal or first-listed diagnosis, even though chemotherapy or
    radiotherapy is administered.
  </p>
  <p>
    g. Symptoms, signs, and abnormal findings listed in Chapter 18 associated
    with neoplasms
  </p>
  <p>
    Symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions listed in Chapter 18
    characteristic of, or associated with, an existing primary or secondary site
    malignancy cannot be used to replace the malignancy as principal or
    first-listed diagnosis, regardless of the number of admissions or encounters
    for treatment and care of the neoplasm. See section I.C.21. Factors
    influencing health status and contact with health services, Encounter for
    prophylactic organ removal.
  </p>
  <p>h. Admission/encounter for pain control/management</p>
  <p>
    See Section I.C.6. for information on coding admission/encounter for pain
    control/management.
  </p>
  <p>Page 34 of 115</p>
  <p>i. Malignancy in two or more noncontiguous sites</p>
  <p>
    A patient may have more than one malignant tumor in the same organ. These
    tumors may represent different primaries or metastatic disease, depending on
    the site. Should the documentation be unclear, the provider should be
    queried as to the status of each tumor so that the correct codes can be
    assigned.
  </p>
  <p>j. Disseminated malignant neoplasm, unspecified</p>
  <p>
    Code C80.0, Disseminated malignant neoplasm, unspecified, is for use only in
    those cases where the patient has advanced metastatic disease and no known
    primary or secondary sites are specified. It should not be used in place of
    assigning codes for the primary site and all known secondary sites.
  </p>
  <p>k. Malignant neoplasm without specification of site</p>
  <p>
    Code C80.1, Malignant (primary) neoplasm, unspecified, equates to Cancer,
    unspecified. This code should only be used when no determination can be made
    as to the primary site of a malignancy. This code should rarely be used in
    the inpatient setting.
  </p>
  <p>l. Sequencing of neoplasm codes</p>
  <p>1) Encounter for treatment of primary malignancy</p>
  <p>
    If the reason for the encounter is for treatment of a primary malignancy,
    assign the malignancy as the principal/first-listed diagnosis. The primary
    site is to be sequenced first, followed by any metastatic sites.
  </p>
  <p>2) Encounter for treatment of secondary malignancy</p>
  <p>
    When an encounter is for a primary malignancy with metastasis and treatment
    is directed toward the metastatic (secondary) site(s) only, the metastatic
    site(s) is designated as the principal/first-listed diagnosis. The primary
    malignancy is coded as an additional code.
  </p>
  <p>3) Malignant neoplasm in a pregnant patient</p>
  <p>4) Encounter for complication associated with a neoplasm</p>
  <p>
    When a pregnant patient has a malignant neoplasm, a code from subcategory
    O9A.1-, Malignant neoplasm complicating pregnancy, childbirth, and the
    puerperium, should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate code from
    Chapter 2 to indicate the type of neoplasm. When an encounter is for
    management of a complication associated with a neoplasm, such as
    dehydration, and the treatment is only for the complication, the
    complication is coded first, followed by the appropriate code(s) for the
    neoplasm.
  </p>
  <p>
    The exception to this guideline is anemia. When the admission/encounter is
    for management of an anemia associated with the malignancy, and the
    treatment is only for anemia, the appropriate code for the malignancy is
  </p>
  <p> Page 35 of 115</p>
  <p>
    sequenced as the principal or first-listed diagnosis followed by code D63.0,
    Anemia in neoplastic disease.
  </p>
  <p>5) Complication from surgical procedure for treatment of a neoplasm</p>
  <p>
    When an encounter is for treatment of a complication resulting from a
    surgical procedure performed for the treatment of the neoplasm, designate
    the complication as the principal/first-listed diagnosis. See the guideline
    regarding the coding of a current malignancy versus personal history to
    determine if the code for the neoplasm should also be assigned.
  </p>
  <p>6) Pathologic fracture due to a neoplasm</p>
  <p>
    When an encounter is for a pathological fracture due to a neoplasm, and the
    focus of treatment is the fracture, a code from subcategory M84.5,
    Pathological fracture in neoplastic disease, should be sequenced first,
    followed by the code for the neoplasm.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the focus of treatment is the neoplasm with an associated pathological
    fracture, the neoplasm code should be sequenced first, followed by a code
    from M84.5 for the pathological fracture.
  </p>
  <p>m. Current malignancy versus personal history of malignancy</p>
  <p>
    When a primary malignancy has been excised but further treatment, such as an
    additional surgery for the malignancy, radiation therapy or chemotherapy is
    directed to that site, the primary malignancy code should be used until
    treatment is completed.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a primary malignancy has been previously excised or eradicated from its
    site, there is no further treatment (of the malignancy) directed to that
    site, and there is no evidence of any existing primary malignancy at that
    site, a code from category Z85, Personal history of malignant neoplasm,
    should be used to indicate the former site of the malignancy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Codes from subcategories Z85.0 – Z85.85 should only be assigned for the
    former site of a primary malignancy, not the site of a secondary malignancy.
    Code Z85.89 may be assigned for the former site(s) of either a primary or
    secondary malignancy. See Section I.C.21. Factors influencing health status
    and contact with health services, History (of)
  </p>
  <p>
    n. Leukemia, Multiple Myeloma, and Malignant Plasma Cell Neoplasms in
    remission versus personal history
  </p>
  <p>
    The categories for leukemia, and category C90, Multiple myeloma and
    malignant plasma cell neoplasms, have codes indicating whether or not the
    leukemia has achieved remission. There are also codes Z85.6, Personal
    history of leukemia, and Z85.79, Personal history of other malignant
    neoplasms of
  </p>
  <p>Page 36 of 115</p>
  <p>
    lymphoid, hematopoietic and related tissues. If the documentation is unclear
    as to whether the leukemia has achieved remission, the provider should be
    queried. See Section I.C.21. Factors influencing health status and contact
    with health services, History (of)

  <p>a. Diabetes mellitus</p>
  <p>
    The diabetes mellitus codes are combination codes that include the type of
    diabetes mellitus, the body system affected, and the complications affecting
    that body system. As many codes within a particular category as are
    necessary to describe all of the complications of the disease may be used.
    They should be sequenced based on the reason for a particular encounter.
    Assign as many codes from categories E08 – E13 as needed to identify all of
    the associated conditions that the patient has.
  </p>
  <p>1) Type of diabetes</p>
  <p>Page 37 of 115</p>
  <p>
    The age of a patient is not the sole determining factor, though most type 1
    diabetics develop the condition before reaching puberty. For this reason,
    type 1 diabetes mellitus is also referred to as juvenile diabetes.
  </p>
  <p>2) Type of diabetes mellitus not documented</p>
  <p>
    If the type of diabetes mellitus is not documented in the medical record the
    default is E11.-, Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
  </p>
  <p>
    3) Diabetes mellitus and the use of insulin, oral hypoglycemics, and
    injectable non-insulin drugs
  </p>
  <p>
    If the documentation in a medical record does not indicate the type of
    diabetes but does indicate that the patient uses insulin, code E11-, Type 2
    diabetes mellitus, should be assigned. Additional code(s) should be assigned
    from category Z79 to identify the long-term (current) use of insulin, oral
    hypoglycemic drugs, or injectable non-insulin antidiabetic, as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    If the patient is treated with both oral medications and insulin, both code
    Z79.4, Long term (current) use of insulin, and code Z79.84, Long term
    (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs, should be assigned. If the patient
    is treated with both insulin and an injectable non-insulin antidiabetic
    drug, assign codes Z79.4, Long term (current) use of insulin, and Z79.899,
    Other long term (current) drug therapy.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the patient is treated with both oral hypoglycemic drugs and an
    injectable non-insulin antidiabetic drug, assign codes Z79.84, Long term
    (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs, and Z79.899, Other long term
    (current) drug therapy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Code Z79.4 should not be assigned if insulin is given temporarily to bring a
    type 2 patient’s blood sugar under control during an encounter.

  <p>5) Complications due to insulin pump malfunction</p>
  <p>(a) Underdose of insulin due to insulin pump failure</p>
  <p>
    An underdose of insulin due to an insulin pump failure should be assigned to
    a code from subcategory T85.6, Mechanical complication of other specified
    internal and external prosthetic devices, implants and grafts, that
    specifies the type of pump malfunction, as the principal or first-listed
    code, followed by code T38.3X6-, Underdosing of insulin and oral
    hypoglycemic [antidiabetic] drugs. Additional codes for the type of diabetes
  </p>
  <p>Page 38 of 115</p>
  <p>
    mellitus and any associated complications due to the underdosing should also
    be assigned.
  </p>
  <p>(b) Overdose of insulin due to insulin pump failure</p>
  <p>
    The principal or first-listed code for an encounter due to an insulin pump
    malfunction resulting in an overdose of insulin, should also be T85.6-,
    Mechanical complication of other specified internal and external prosthetic
    devices, implants and grafts, followed by code T38.3X1-, Poisoning by
    insulin and oral hypoglycemic [antidiabetic] drugs, accidental
    (unintentional).
  </p>
  <p>6) Secondary diabetes mellitus</p>
  <p>
    Codes under categories E08, Diabetes mellitus due to underlying condition,
    E09, Drug or chemical induced diabetes mellitus, and E13, Other specified
    diabetes mellitus, identify complications/manifestations associated with
    secondary diabetes mellitus. Secondary diabetes is always caused by another
    condition or event (e.g., cystic fibrosis, malignant neoplasm of pancreas,
    pancreatectomy, adverse effect of drug, or poisoning).
  </p>
  <p>
    (a) Secondary diabetes mellitus and the use of insulin, oral hypoglycemic
    drugs, or injectable non-insulin drugs
  </p>
  <p>
    For patients with secondary diabetes mellitus who routinely use insulin,
    oral hypoglycemic drugs, or injectable non-insulin drugs, additional code(s)
    from category Z79 should be assigned to identify the long-term (current) use
    of insulin, oral hypoglycemic drugs, or non-injectable non-insulin drugs as
    follows: If the patient is treated with both oral medications and insulin,
    both code Z79.4, Long term (current) use of insulin, and code Z79.84, Long
    term (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs, should be assigned.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the patient is treated with both insulin and an injectable non- insulin
    antidiabetic drug, assign codes Z79.4, Longterm (current) use of insulin,
    and Z79.899, Other long term (current) drug therapy.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the patient is treated with both oral hypoglycemic drugs and an
    injectable non-insulin antidiabetic drug, assign codes Z79.84, Long-term
    (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs, and Z79.899, Other long-term
    (current) drug therapy. Code Z79.4 should not be assigned if insulin is
    given temporarily to bring a secondary diabetic patient’s blood sugar under
    control during an encounter.
  </p>
  <p>Page 39 of 115</p>
  <p>(b) Assigning and sequencing secondary diabetes codes and its causes</p>
  <p>
    The sequencing of the secondary diabetes codes in relationship to codes for
    the cause of the diabetes is based on the Tabular List instructions for
    categories E08, E09 and E13.
  </p>
  <p>(i) Secondary diabetes mellitus due to pancreatectomy</p>
  <p>
    For postpancreatectomy diabetes mellitus (lack of insulin due to the
    surgical removal of all or part of the pancreas), assign code E89.1,
    Postprocedural hypoinsulinemia. Assign a code from category E13 and a code
    from subcategory Z90.41, Acquired absence of pancreas, as additional codes.
  </p>
  <p>(ii) Secondary diabetes due to drugs</p>
  <p>
    Secondary diabetes may be caused by an adverse effect of correctly
    administered medications, poisoning or sequela of poisoning.

    5. Chapter 5: Mental, Behavioral and Neurodevelopmental disorders (F01 –
    F99)
  </h4>
  <p>a. Pain disorders related to psychological factors</p>
  <p>
    Assign code F45.41, for pain that is exclusively related to psychological
    disorders. As indicated by the Excludes 1 note under category G89, a code
    from category G89 should not be assigned with code F45.41. Code F45.42, Pain
    disorders with related psychological factors, should be used with a code
    from category G89, Pain, not elsewhere classified, if there is documentation
    of a psychological component for a patient with acute or chronic pain. See
    Section I.C.6. Pain
  </p>
  <p>b. Mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use</p>
  <p>1) In Remission</p>
  <p>
    Selection of codes for “in remission” for categories F10-F19, Mental and
    behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use (categories F10F19
    with -.11, -.21) requires the provider’s clinical judgment. The appropriate
    codes for “in remission” are assigned only on the basis of provider
    documentation (as defined in the Official Guidelines for Coding and
    Reporting), unless otherwise instructed by the classification.
  </p>
  <p>Page 40 of 115</p>
  <p>
    Mild substance use disorders in early or sustained remission are classified
    to the appropriate codes for substance abuse in remission, and moderate or
    severe substance use disorders in early or sustained remission are
    classified to the appropriate codes for substance dependence in remission.
  </p>
  <p>2) Psychoactive Substance Use, Abuse and Dependence</p>
  <p>
    When the provider documentation refers to use, abuse and dependence of the
    same substance (e.g. alcohol, opioid, cannabis, etc.), only one code should
    be assigned to identify the pattern of use based on the following hierarchy:
    • If both use and abuse are documented, assign only the code for abuse • If
    both abuse and dependence are documented, assign only the code for
    dependence • If use, abuse and dependence are all documented, assign only
    the code for dependence • If both use and dependence are documented, assign
    only the code for dependence.
  </p>
  <p>3) Psychoactive Substance Use, Unspecified</p>
  <p>
    As with all other unspecified diagnoses, the codes for unspecified
    psychoactive substance use (F10.9-, F11.9-, F12.9-, F13.9-, F14.9-, F15.9-,
    F16.9-, F18.9-, F19.9-) should only be assigned based on provider
    documentation and when they meet the definition of a reportable diagnosis
    (see Section III, Reporting Additional Diagnoses). These codes are to be
    used only when the psychoactive substance use is associated with a substance
    related disorder (chapter 5 disorders such as sexual dysfunction, sleep
    disorder, or a mental or behavioral disorder) or medical condition, and such
    a relationship is documented by the provider.
  </p>
  <p>
    4) Medical Conditions Due to Psychoactive Substance Use, Abuse and
    Dependence
  </p>
  <p>
    Medical conditions due to substance use, abuse, and dependence are not
    classified as substance-induced disorders. Assign the diagnosis code for the
    medical condition as directed by the Alphabetical Index along with the
    appropriate psychoactive substance use, abuse or dependence code. For
    example, for alcoholic pancreatitis due to alcohol dependence, assign the
    appropriate code from subcategory K85.2, Alcohol induced acute pancreatitis,
    and the appropriate code from subcategory F10.2, such as code F10.20,
    Alcohol dependence, uncomplicated. It would not be appropriate to assign
    code F10.288, Alcohol dependence with other alcohol-induced disorder.
  </p>
  <p>5) Blood Alcohol Level</p>
  <p>Page 41 of 115</p>
  <p>
    A code from category Y90, Evidence of alcohol involvement determined by
    blood alcohol level, may be assigned when this information is documented and
    the patient’s provider has documented a condition classifiable to category
    F10, Alcohol related disorders. The blood alcohol level does not need to be
    documented by the patient’s provider in order for it to be coded.
  </p>
  <p>c. Factitious Disorder</p>
  <p>
    Factitious disorder imposed on self or Munchausen’s syndrome is a disorder
    in which a person falsely reports or causes his or her own physical or
    psychological signs or symptoms. For patients with documented factitious
    disorder on self or Munchausen’s syndrome, assign the appropriate code from
    subcategory F68.1-, Factitious disorder imposed on self.
  </p>
  <p>
    Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy (MSBP) is a disorder in which a caregiver
    (perpetrator) falsely reports or causes an illness or injury in another
    person (victim) under his or her care, such as a child, an elderly adult, or
    a person who has a disability. The condition is also referred to as
    “factitious disorder imposed on another” or “factitious disorder by proxy.”
    The perpetrator, not the victim, receives this diagnosis. Assign code F68.A,
    Factitious disorder imposed on another, to the perpetrator’s record. For the
    victim of a patient suffering from MSBP, assign the appropriate code from
    categories T74, Adult and child abuse, neglect and other maltreatment,
    confirmed, or T76, Adult and child abuse, neglect and other maltreatment,
    suspected. See Section I.C.19.f. Adult and child abuse, neglect and other
    maltreatment
  </p>
  <h4 id="IC06">6. Chapter 6: Diseases of the Nervous System (G00-G99)</h4>
  <p>a. Dominant/nondominant side</p>
  <p>
    Codes from category G81, Hemiplegia and hemiparesis, and subcategories
    G83.1, Monoplegia of lower limb, G83.2, Monoplegia of upper limb, and G83.3,
    Monoplegia, unspecified, identify whether the dominant or nondominant side
    is affected. Should the affected side be documented, but not specified as
    dominant or nondominant, and the classification system does not indicate a
    default, code selection is as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    • For ambidextrous patients, the default should be dominant. • If the left
    side is affected, the default is non-dominant. • If the right side is
    affected, the default is dominant.
  </p>
  <p>b. Pain - Category G89</p>
  <p>1) General coding information</p>
  <p>
    Codes in category G89, Pain, not elsewhere classified, may be used in
    conjunction with codes from other categories and chapters to provide more
    detail about acute or chronic pain and neoplasm-related pain, unless
    otherwise indicated below.
  </p>
  <p>Page 42 of 115</p>
  <p>
    If the pain is not specified as acute or chronic, post-thoracotomy,
    postprocedural, or neoplasm-related, do not assign codes from category G89.
  </p>
  <p>
    A code from category G89 should not be assigned if the underlying
    (definitive) diagnosis is known, unless the reason for the encounter is pain
    control/ management and not management of the underlying condition.
  </p>
  <p>
    When an admission or encounter is for a procedure aimed at treating the
    underlying condition (e.g., spinal fusion, kyphoplasty), a code for the
    underlying condition (e.g., vertebral fracture, spinal stenosis) should be
    assigned as the principal diagnosis. No code from category G89 should be
    assigned.
  </p>
  <p>(a) Category G89 Codes as Principal or First-Listed Diagnosis</p>
  <p>
    Category G89 codes are acceptable as principal diagnosis or the first-listed
    code:
  </p>
  <p>
    • When pain control or pain management is the reason for the
    admission/encounter (e.g., a patient with displaced intervertebral disc,
    nerve impingement and severe back pain presents for injection of steroid
    into the spinal canal). The underlying cause of the pain should be reported
    as an additional diagnosis, if known.
  </p>
  <p>
    • When a patient is admitted for the insertion of a neurostimulator for pain
    control, assign the appropriate pain code as the principal or first-listed
    diagnosis. When an admission or encounter is for a procedure aimed at
    treating the underlying condition and a neurostimulator is inserted for pain
    control during the same admission/encounter, a code for the underlying
    condition should be assigned as the principal diagnosis and the appropriate
    pain code should be assigned as a secondary diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    (b) Use of Category G89 Codes in Conjunction with Site Specific Pain Codes
  </p>
  <p>(i) Assigning Category G89 and Site-Specific Pain Codes</p>
  <p>
    Codes from category G89 may be used in conjunction with codes that identify
    the site of pain (including codes from chapter 18) if the category G89 code
    provides additional information. For example, if the code describes the site
    of the pain, but does not fully describe whether the pain is acute or
    chronic, then both codes should be assigned.
  </p>
  <p>(ii) Sequencing of Category G89 Codes with Site-Specific Pain Codes</p>
  <p>Page 43 of 115</p>
  <p>
    The sequencing of category G89 codes with site- specific pain codes
    (including chapter 18 codes), is dependent on the circumstances of the
    encounter/admission as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    • If the encounter is for pain control or pain management, assign the code
    from category G89 followed by the code identifying the specific site of pain
    (e.g., encounter for pain management for acute neck pain from trauma is
    assigned code G89.11, Acute pain due to trauma, followed by code M54.2,
    Cervicalgia, to identify the site of pain).
  </p>
  <p>
    • If the encounter is for any other reason except pain control or pain
    management, and a related definitive diagnosis has not been established
    (confirmed) by the provider, assign the code for the specific site of pain
    first, followed by the appropriate code from category G89.
  </p>
  <p>
    2)Pain due to devices, implants and grafts See Section I.C.19. Pain due to
    medical devices
  </p>
  <p>3) Postoperative Pain</p>
  <p>
    The provider’s documentation should be used to guide the coding of
    postoperative pain, as well as Section III. Reporting Additional Diagnoses
    and Section IV. Diagnostic Coding and Reporting in the Outpatient Setting.
  </p>
  <p>
    The default for post-thoracotomy and other postoperative pain not specified
    as acute or chronic is the code for the acute form. Routine or expected
    postoperative pain immediately after surgery should not be coded.
  </p>
  <p>
    (a) Postoperative pain not associated with specific postoperative
    complication
  </p>
  <p>
    Postoperative pain not associated with a specific postoperative complication
    is assigned to the appropriate postoperative pain code in category G89.
  </p>
  <p>
    (b) Postoperative pain associated with specific postoperative complication
  </p>
  <p>
    Postoperative pain associated with a specific postoperative complication
    (such as painful wire sutures) is assigned to the appropriate code(s) found
    in Chapter 19, Injury, poisoning, and certain other consequences of external
    causes. If appropriate, use additional code(s) from category G89 to identify
    acute or chronic pain (G89.18 or G89.28).
  </p>
  <p>Page 44 of 115</p>
  <p>4) Chronic pain</p>
  <p>
    Chronic pain is classified to subcategory G89.2. There is no time frame
    defining when pain becomes chronic pain. The provider’s documentation should
    be used to guide use of these codes.
  </p>
  <p>5) Neoplasm Related Pain</p>
  <p>
    Code G89.3 is assigned to pain documented as being related, associated or
    due to cancer, primary or secondary malignancy, or tumor. This code is
    assigned regardless of whether the pain is acute or chronic. This code may
    be assigned as the principal or first-listed code when the stated reason for
    the admission/encounter is documented as pain control/pain management. The
    underlying neoplasm should be reported as an additional diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the reason for the admission/encounter is management of the neoplasm
    and the pain associated with the neoplasm is also documented, code G89.3 may
    be assigned as an additional diagnosis. It is not necessary to assign an
    additional code for the site of the pain. See Section I.C.2 for instructions
    on the sequencing of neoplasms for all other stated reasons for the
    admission/encounter (except for pain control/pain management).
  </p>
  <p>6) Chronic pain syndrome</p>
  <p>
    Central pain syndrome (G89.0) and chronic pain syndrome (G89.4) are
    different than the term “chronic pain,” and therefore codes should only be
    used when the provider has specifically documented this condition. See
    Section I.C.5. Pain disorders related to psychological factors
  </p>
  <h4 id="IC07">7. Chapter 7: Diseases of the Eye and Adnexa (H00-H59)</h4>
  <p>a. Glaucoma</p>
  <p>1) Assigning Glaucoma Codes</p>
  <p>
    Assign as many codes from category p0, Glaucoma, as needed to identify the
    type of glaucoma, the affected eye, and the glaucoma stage.
  </p>
  <p>2) Bilateral glaucoma with same type and stage</p>
  <p>
    When a patient has bilateral glaucoma and both eyes are documented as being
    the same type and stage, and there is a code for bilateral glaucoma, report
    only the code for the type of glaucoma, bilateral, with the seventh
    character for the stage.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a patient has bilateral glaucoma and both eyes are documented as being
    the same type and stage, and the classification does not provide a code for
    bilateral glaucoma (i.e. subcategories p0.10, and p0.20)
  </p>
  <p>Page 45 of 115</p>
  <p>
    report only one code for the type of glaucoma with the appropriate seventh
    character for the stage.
  </p>
  <p>3) Bilateral glaucoma stage with different types or stages</p>
  <p>
    When a patient has bilateral glaucoma and each eye is documented as having a
    different type or stage, and the classification distinguishes laterality,
    assign the appropriate code for each eye rather than the code for bilateral
    glaucoma.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a patient has bilateral glaucoma and each eye is documented as having a
    different type, and the classification does not distinguish laterality
    (i.e., subcategories p0.10, and p0.20), assign one code for each type of
    glaucoma with the appropriate seventh character for the stage.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a patient has bilateral glaucoma and each eye is documented as having
    the same type, but different stage, and the classification does not
    distinguish laterality (i.e., subcategories p0.10 and p0.20), assign a
    code for the type of glaucoma for each eye with the seventh character for
    the specific glaucoma stage documented for each eye.
  </p>
  <p>
    4) Patient admitted with glaucoma and stage evolves during the admission
  </p>
  <p>
    If a patient is admitted with glaucoma and the stage progresses during the
    admission, assign the code for highest stage documented.
  </p>
  <p>5) Indeterminate stage glaucoma</p>
  <p>
    Assignment of the seventh character “4” for “indeterminate stage” should be
    based on the clinical documentation. The seventh character “4” is used for
    glaucomas whose stage cannot be clinically determined. This seventh
    character should not be confused with the seventh character “0”,
    unspecified, which should be assigned when there is no documentation
    regarding the stage of the glaucoma.
  </p>
  <p>b. Blindness</p>
  <p>
    If “blindness” or “low vision” of both eyes is documented but the visual
    impairment category is not documented, assign code H54.3, Unqualified visual
    loss, both eyes. If “blindness” or “low vision” in one eye is documented but
    the visual impairment category is not documented, assign a code from H54.6-,
    Unqualified visual loss, one eye. If “blindness” or “visual loss” is
    documented without any information about whether one or both eyes are
    affected, assign code H54.7, Unspecified visual loss.

  <h4 id="IC09">9. Chapter 9: Diseases of the Circulatory System (I00-I99)</h4>
  <p>a. Hypertension</p>
  <p>
    The classification presumes a causal relationship between hypertension and
    heart involvement and between hypertension and kidney involvement, as the
    two conditions are linked by the term “with” in the Alphabetic Index. These
    conditions should be coded as related even in the absence of provider
    documentation explicitly linking them, unless the documentation clearly
    states the conditions are unrelated.
  </p>
  <p>
    For hypertension and conditions not specifically linked by relational terms
    such as “with,” “associated with” or “due to” in the classification,
    provider documentation must link the conditions in order to code them as
    related.
  </p>
  <p>1) Hypertension with Heart Disease</p>
  <p>
    Hypertension with heart conditions classified to I50.- or I51.4- I51.7,
    I51.89, I51.9, are assigned to a code from category I11, Hypertensive heart
    disease. Use additional code(s) from category I50, Heart failure, to
    identify the type(s) of heart failure in those patients with heart failure.
    The same heart conditions (I50.-, I51.4-I51.7, I51.89, I51.9) with
    hypertension are coded separately if the provider has documented they are
    unrelated to the hypertension. Sequence according to the circumstances of
    the admission/encounter.
  </p>
  <p>2) Hypertensive Chronic Kidney Disease</p>
  <p>
    Assign codes from category I12, Hypertensive chronic kidney disease, when
    both hypertension and a condition classifiable to category N18, Chronic
    kidney disease (CKD), are present. CKD should not be coded as hypertensive
    if the provider indicates the CKD is not related to the hypertension.
  </p>
  <p>
    The appropriate code from category N18 should be used as a secondary code
    with a code from category I12 to identify the stage of chronic kidney
    disease.
  </p>
  <p>
    See Section I.C.14. Chronic kidney disease. If a patient has hypertensive
    chronic kidney disease and acute renal failure, the acute renal failure
    should also be coded. Sequence according to the circumstances of the
    admission/encounter.
  </p>
  <p>3) Hypertensive Heart and Chronic Kidney Disease</p>
  <p>
    Assign codes from combination category I13, Hypertensive heart and chronic
    kidney disease, when there is hypertension with both heart and kidney
    involvement. If heart failure is present, assign an additional code from
    category I50 to identify the type of heart failure.
  </p>
  <p>Page 47 of 115</p>
  <p>
    The appropriate code from category N18, Chronic kidney disease, should be
    used as a secondary code with a code from category I13 to identify the stage
    of chronic kidney disease. See Section I.C.14. Chronic kidney disease.
  </p>
  <p>
    The codes in category I13, Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease,
    are combination codes that include hypertension, heart disease and chronic
    kidney disease. The Includes note at I13 specifies that the conditions
    included at I11 and I12 are included together in I13. If a patient has
    hypertension, heart disease and chronic kidney disease, then a code from I13
    should be used, not individual codes for hypertension, heart disease and
    chronic kidney disease, or codes from I11 or I12. For patients with both
    acute renal failure and chronic kidney disease, the acute renal failure
    should also be coded. Sequence according to the circumstances of the
    admission/encounter.
  </p>
  <p>4) Hypertensive Cerebrovascular Disease</p>
  <p>
    For hypertensive cerebrovascular disease, first assign the appropriate code
    from categories I60-I69, followed by the appropriate hypertension code.
  </p>
  <p>5) Hypertensive Retinopathy</p>
  <p>
    Subcategory h45.0, Background retinopathy and retinal vascular changes,
    should be used along with a code from categories I10 – I15, in the
    Hypertensive diseases section, to include the systemic hypertension. The
    sequencing is based on the reason for the encounter.
  </p>
  <p>6) Hypertension, Secondary</p>
  <p>
    Secondary hypertension is due to an underlying condition. Two codes are
    required: one to identify the underlying etiology and one from category I15
    to identify the hypertension. Sequencing of codes is determined by the
    reason for admission/encounter.
  </p>
  <p>7) Hypertension, Transient</p>
  <p>
    Assign code R03.0, Elevated blood pressure reading without diagnosis of
    hypertension, unless patient has an established diagnosis of hypertension.
    Assign code O13.-, Gestational [pregnancy-induced] hypertension without
    significant proteinuria, or O14.-, Pre-eclampsia, for transient hypertension
    of pregnancy.
  </p>
  <p>8) Hypertension, Controlled</p>
  <p>
    This diagnostic statement usually refers to an existing state of
    hypertension under control by therapy. Assign the appropriate code from
    categories I10-I15, Hypertensive diseases.
  </p>
  <p>9) Hypertension, Uncontrolled</p>
  <p>Page 48 of 115</p>
  <p>
    Uncontrolled hypertension may refer to untreated hypertension or
    hypertension not responding to current therapeutic regimen. In either case,
    assign the appropriate code from categories I10-I15, Hypertensive diseases.
  </p>
  <p>10) Hypertensive Crisis</p>
  <p>
    Assign a code from category I16, Hypertensive crisis, for documented
    hypertensive urgency, hypertensive emergency or unspecified hypertensive
    crisis. Code also any identified hypertensive disease (I10I15). The
    sequencing is based on the reason for the encounter.
  </p>
  <p>11) Pulmonary Hypertension</p>
  <p>
    Pulmonary hypertension is classified to category I27, Other pulmonary heart
    diseases. For secondary pulmonary hypertension (I27.1, I27.2-), code also
    any associated conditions or adverse effects of drugs or toxins. The
    sequencing is based on the reason for the encounter, except for adverse
    effects of drugs (See Section I.C.19.e.).
  </p>
  <p>b. Atherosclerotic Coronary Artery Disease and Angina</p>
  <p>
    ICD-10-CM has combination codes for atherosclerotic heart disease with
    angina pectoris. The subcategories for these codes are I25.11,
    Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with angina pectoris
    and I25.7, Atherosclerosis of coronary artery bypass graft(s) and coronary
    artery of transplanted heart with angina pectoris.
  </p>
  <p>
    When using one of these combination codes it is not necessary to use an
    additional code for angina pectoris. A causal relationship can be assumed in
    a patient with both atherosclerosis and angina pectoris, unless the
    documentation indicates the angina is due to something other than the
    atherosclerosis. If a patient with coronary artery disease is admitted due
    to an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the AMI should be sequenced before
    the coronary artery disease.
  </p>
  <p>See Section I.C.9. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)</p>
  <p>c. Intraoperative and Postprocedural Cerebrovascular Accident</p>
  <p>
    Medical record documentation should clearly specify the cause- and-effect
    relationship between the medical intervention and the cerebrovascular
    accident in order to assign a code for intraoperative or postprocedural
    cerebrovascular accident.
  </p>
  <p>
    Proper code assignment depends on whether it was an infarction or hemorrhage
    and whether it occurred intraoperatively or postoperatively. If it was a
    cerebral hemorrhage, code assignment depends on the type of procedure
    performed.
  </p>
  <p> Page 49 of 115</p>
  <p>d. Sequelae of Cerebrovascular Disease</p>
  <p>1) Category I69, Sequelae of Cerebrovascular disease</p>
  <p>
    Category I69 is used to indicate conditions classifiable to categories
    I60I67 as the causes of sequela (neurologic deficits), themselves classified
    elsewhere. These “late effects” include neurologic deficits that persist
    after initial onset of conditions classifiable to categories I60-I67. The
    neurologic deficits caused by cerebrovascular disease may be present from
    the onset or may arise at any time after the onset of the condition
    classifiable to categories I60-I67.
  </p>
  <p>
    Codes from category I69, Sequelae of cerebrovascular disease, that specify
    hemiplegia, hemiparesis and monoplegia identify whether the dominant or
    nondominant side is affected. Should the affected side be documented, but
    not specified as dominant or nondominant, and the classification system does
    not indicate a default, code selection is as follows: • For ambidextrous
    patients, the default should be dominant. • If the left side is affected,
    the default is non-dominant. • If the right side is affected, the default is
    dominant.
  </p>
  <p>2) Codes from category I69 with codes from I60-I67</p>
  <p>
    Codes from category I69 may be assigned on a health care record with codes
    from I60-I67, if the patient has a current cerebrovascular disease and
    deficits from an old cerebrovascular disease.
  </p>
  <p>
    3) Codes from category I69 and Personal history of transient ischemic attack
    (TIA) and cerebral infarction (Z86.73)
  </p>
  <p>
    Codes from category I69 should not be assigned if the patient does not have
    neurologic deficits.
  </p>
  <p>See Section I.C.21. 4. History (of) for use of personal history codes</p>
  <p>e. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)</p>
  <p>
    1) Type 1 ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and nonST elevation
    myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)
  </p>
  <p>
    The ICD-10-CM codes for type 1 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) identify
    the site, such as anterolateral wall or true posterior wall. Subcategories
    I21.0-I21.2 and code I21.3 are used for type 1 ST elevation myocardial
    infarction (STEMI). Code I21.4, Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial
    infarction, is used for type 1 non-ST elevation myocardial infarction
    (NSTEMI) and nontransmural MIs. If a type 1 NSTEMI evolves to STEMI, assign
    the STEMI code. If a type 1 STEMI converts to NSTEMI due to thrombolytic
    therapy, it is still coded as STEMI.
  </p>
  <p>Page 50 of 115</p>
  <p>
    For encounters occurring while the myocardial infarction is equal to, or
    less than, four weeks old, including transfers to another acute setting or a
    postacute setting, and the myocardial infarction meets the definition for
    “other diagnoses” (see Section III, Reporting Additional Diagnoses), codes
    from category I21 may continue to be reported. For encounters after the
    4-week time frame and the patient is still receiving care related to the
    myocardial infarction, the appropriate aftercare code should be assigned,
    rather than a code from category I21. For old or healed myocardial
    infarctions not requiring further care, code I25.2, Old myocardial
    infarction, may be assigned.
  </p>
  <p>2) Acute myocardial infarction, unspecified</p>
  <p>
    Code I21.9, Acute myocardial infarction, unspecified, is the default for
    unspecified acute myocardial infarction or unspecified type. If only type 1
    STEMI or transmural MI without the site is documented, assign code I21.3, ST
    elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction of unspecified site.
  </p>
  <p>3) AMI documented as nontransmural or subendocardial but site provided</p>
  <p>
    If an AMI is documented as nontransmural or subendocardial, but the site is
    provided, it is still coded as a subendocardial AMI. See Section I.C.21.3
    for information on coding status post administration of tPA in a different
    facility within the last 24 hours.
  </p>
  <p>4) Subsequent acute myocardial infarction</p>
  <p>
    A code from category I22, Subsequent ST elevation (STEMI) and nonST
    elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction, is to be used when a patient who
    has suffered a type 1 or unspecified AMI has a new AMI within the 4 week
    time frame of the initial AMI. A code from category I22 must be used in
    conjunction with a code from category I21. The sequencing of the I22 and I21
    codes depends on the circumstances of the encounter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do not assign code I22 for subsequent myocardial infarctions other than type
    1 or unspecified. For subsequent type 2 AMI assign only code I21.A1. For
    subsequent type 4 or type 5 AMI, assign only code I21.A9. If a subsequent
    myocardial infarction of one type occurs within 4 weeks of a myocardial
    infarction of a different type, assign the appropriate codes from category
    I21 to identify each type. Do not assign a code from I22. Codes from
    category I22 should only be assigned if both the initial and subsequent
    myocardial infarctions are type 1 or unspecified.
  </p>
  <p>5) Other Types of Myocardial Infarction</p>
  <p>
    The ICD-10-CM provides codes for different types of myocardial infarction.
    Type 1 myocardial infarctions are assigned to codes I21.0I21.4.
  </p>
  <p>Page 51 of 115</p>
  <p>
    Type 2 myocardial infarction (myocardial infarction due to demand ischemia
    or secondary to ischemic imbalance) is assigned to code I21.A1, Myocardial
    infarction type 2 with the underlying cause coded first. Do not assign code
    I24.8, Other forms of acute ischemic heart disease, for the demand ischemia.
    If a type 2 AMI is described as NSTEMI or STEMI, only assign code I21.A1.
    Codes I21.01-I21.4 should only be assigned for type 1 AMIs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Acute myocardial infarctions type 3, 4a, 4b, 4c and 5 are assigned to code
    I21.A9, Other myocardial infarction type. The "Code also" and "Code first"
    notes should be followed related to complications, and for coding of
    postprocedural myocardial infarctions during or following cardiac surgery.

  <h4 id="IC10">10. Chapter 10: Diseases of the Respiratory System (J00-J99), U07.0</h4>
  <p>a. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease [COPD] and Asthma</p>
  <p>1) Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive bronchitis and asthma</p> 
  <p>
    The codes in categories J44 and J45 distinguish between uncomplicated cases
    and those in acute exacerbation. An acute exacerbation is a worsening or a
    decompensation of a chronic condition. An acute exacerbation is not
    equivalent to an infection superimposed on a chronic condition, though an
    exacerbation may be triggered by an infection.
  </p>
  <p>b. Acute Respiratory Failure</p>
  <p>1) Acute respiratory failure as principal diagnosis</p>
  <p>
    A code from subcategory J96.0, Acute respiratory failure, or subcategory
    J96.2, Acute and chronic respiratory failure, may be assigned as a principal
    diagnosis when it is the condition established after study to be chiefly
    responsible for occasioning the admission to the hospital, and the selection
    is supported by the Alphabetic Index and Tabular List. However, chapter-
    specific coding guidelines (such as obstetrics, poisoning, HIV, newborn)
    that provide sequencing direction take precedence.
  </p>
  <p>2) Acute respiratory failure as secondary diagnosis</p>
  <p>
    Respiratory failure may be listed as a secondary diagnosis if it occurs
    after admission, or if it is present on admission, but does not meet the
    definition of principal diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>3) Sequencing of acute respiratory failure and another acute condition</p>
  <p>Page 52 of 115</p>
  <p>
    When a patient is admitted with respiratory failure and another acute
    condition, (e.g., myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident,
    aspiration pneumonia), the principal diagnosis will not be the same in every
    situation. This applies whether the other acute condition is a respiratory
    or nonrespiratory condition. Selection of the principal diagnosis will be
    dependent on the circumstances of admission. If both the respiratory failure
    and the other acute condition are equally responsible for occasioning the
    admission to the hospital, and there are no chapter-specific sequencing
    rules, the guideline regarding two or more diagnoses that equally meet the
    definition for principal diagnosis (Section II, C.) may be applied in these
    situations.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the documentation is not clear as to whether acute respiratory failure
    and another condition are equally responsible for occasioning the admission,
    query the provider for clarification.
  </p>
  <p>c. Influenza due to certain identified influenza viruses</p>
  <p>
    Code only confirmed cases of influenza due to certain identified influenza
    viruses (category J09), and due to other identified influenza virus
    (category J10). This is an exception to the hospital inpatient guideline
    Section II, H. (Uncertain Diagnosis).
  </p>
  <p>
    In this context, “confirmation” does not require documentation of positive
    laboratory testing specific for avian or other novel influenza A or other
    identified influenza virus. However, coding should be based on the
    provider’s diagnostic statement that the patient has avian influenza, or
    other novel influenza A, for category J09, or has another particular
    identified strain of influenza, such as H1N1 or h4N2, but not identified as
    novel or variant, for category J10.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the provider records “suspected” or “possible” or “probable” avian
    influenza, or novel influenza, or other identified influenza, then the
    appropriate influenza code from category J11, Influenza due to unidentified
    influenza virus, should be assigned. A code from category J09, Influenza due
    to certain identified influenza viruses, should not be assigned nor should a
    code from category J10, Influenza due to other identified influenza virus.
  </p>
  <p>d. Ventilator associated Pneumonia</p>
  <p>1) Documentation of Ventilator associated Pneumonia</p>
  <p>
    As with all procedural or postprocedural complications, code assignment is
    based on the provider’s documentation of the relationship between the
    condition and the procedure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Code J95.851, Ventilator associated pneumonia, should be assigned only when
    the provider has documented ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). An
    additional code to identify the organism (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, code
    B96.5) should also be assigned. Do not assign an
  </p>
  <p>Page 53 of 115</p>
  <p>
    additional code from categories J12-J18 to identify the type of pneumonia.
  </p>
  <p>
    Code J95.851 should not be assigned for cases where the patient has
    pneumonia and is on a mechanical ventilator and the provider has not
    specifically stated that the pneumonia is ventilator-associated pneumonia.
    If the documentation is unclear as to whether the patient has a pneumonia
    that is a complication attributable to the mechanical ventilator, query the
    provider.
  </p>
  <p>2) Ventilator associated Pneumonia Develops after Admission</p>
  <p>
    A patient may be admitted with one type of pneumonia (e.g., code J13,
    Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumonia) and subsequently develop VAP. In
    this instance, the principal diagnosis would be the appropriate code from
    categories J12-J18 for the pneumonia diagnosed at the time of admission.
    Code J95.851, Ventilator associated pneumonia, would be assigned as an
    additional diagnosis when the provider has also documented the presence of
    ventilator associated pneumonia.
  </p>
  <p>e. Vaping-related disorders</p>
  <p>
    For patients presenting with condition(s) related to vaping, assign code
    U07.0, Vaping-related disorder, as the principal diagnosis. For lung injury
    due to vaping, assign only code U07.0. Assign additional codes for other
    manifestations, such as acute respiratory failure (subcategory J96.0-) or
    pneumonitis (code J68.0).
  </p>
  <p>
    Associated respiratory signs and symptoms due to vaping, such as cough,
    shortness of breath, etc., are not coded separately, when a definitive
    diagnosis has been established. However, it would be appropriate to code
    separately any gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and abdominal
    pain. See Section I.C.1.g.1.c.i. for Pneumonia confirmed as due to COVID-19

  <p>a. Pressure ulcer stage codes</p>
  <p>1) Pressure ulcer stages</p>
  <p>
    Codes in category L89, Pressure ulcer, identify the site and stage of the
    pressure ulcer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ICD-10-CM classifies pressure ulcer stages based on severity, which is
    designated by stages 1-4, deep tissue pressure injury, unspecified stage,
    and unstageable.
  </p>
  <p>Page 54 of 115</p>
  <p>
    Assign as many codes from category L89 as needed to identify all the
    pressure ulcers the patient has, if applicable.
  </p>
  <p>
    See Section I.B.14 for pressure ulcer stage documentation by clinicians
    other than patient's provider.
  </p>
  <p>2) Unstageable pressure ulcers</p>
  <p>
    Assignment of the code for unstageable pressure ulcer (L89.--0) should be
    based on the clinical documentation. These codes are used for pressure
    ulcers whose stage cannot be clinically determined (e.g., the ulcer is
    covered by eschar or has been treated with a skin or muscle graft). This
    code should not be confused with the codes for unspecified stage (L89.--9).
    When there is no documentation regarding the stage of the pressure ulcer,
    assign the appropriate code for unspecified stage (L89.-- 9).
  </p>
  <p>
    If during an encounter, the stage of an unstageable pressure ulcer is
    revealed after debridement, assign only the code for the stage revealed
    following debridement.
  </p>
  <p>3) Documented pressure ulcer stage</p>
  <p>
    Assignment of the pressure ulcer stage code should be guided by clinical
    documentation of the stage or documentation of the terms found in the
    Alphabetic Index. For clinical terms describing the stage that are not found
    in the Alphabetic Index, and there is no documentation of the stage, the
    provider should be queried.
  </p>
  <p>4) Patients admitted with pressure ulcers documented as healed</p>
  <p>
    No code is assigned if the documentation states that the pressure ulcer is
    completely healed at the time of admission.
  </p>
  <p>5) Pressure ulcers documented as healing</p>
  <p>
    Pressure ulcers described as healing should be assigned the appropriate
    pressure ulcer stage code based on the documentation in the medical record.
    If the documentation does not provide information about the stage of the
    healing pressure ulcer, assign the appropriate code for unspecified stage.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the documentation is unclear as to whether the patient has a current
    (new) pressure ulcer or if the patient is being treated for a healing
    pressure ulcer, query the provider.
  </p>
  <p>
    For ulcers that were present on admission but healed at the time of
    discharge, assign the code for the site and stage of the pressure ulcer at
    the time of admission.
  </p>
  <p>Page 55 of 115</p>
  <p>
    6) Patient admitted with pressure ulcer evolving into another stage during
    the admission
  </p>
  <p>
    If a patient is admitted to an inpatient hospital with a pressure ulcer at
    one stage and it progresses to a higher stage, two separate codes should be
    assigned: one code for the site and stage of the ulcer on admission and a
    second code for the same ulcer site and the highest stage reported during
    the stay.
  </p>
  <p>7) Pressure-induced deep tissue damage</p>
  <p>
    For pressure-induced deep tissue damage or deep tissue pressure injury,
    assign only the appropriate code for pressure-induced deep tissue damage
    (L89.--6).
  </p>
  <p>b. Non-Pressure Chronic Ulcers</p>
  <p>1) Patients admitted with non-pressure ulcers documented as healed</p>
  <p>
    No code is assigned if the documentation states that the non-pressure ulcer
    is completely healed at the time of admission.
  </p>
  <p>2) Non-pressure ulcers documented as healing</p>
  <p>
    Non-pressure ulcers described as healing should be assigned the appropriate
    non-pressure ulcer code based on the documentation in the medical record. If
    the documentation does not provide information about the severity of the
    healing non-pressure ulcer, assign the appropriate code for unspecified
    severity.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the documentation is unclear as to whether the patient has a current
    (new) non-pressure ulcer or if the patient is being treated for a healing
    non-pressure ulcer, query the provider.
  </p>
  <p>
    For ulcers that were present on admission but healed at the time of
    discharge, assign the code for the site and severity of the non-pressure
    ulcer at the time of admission.
  </p>
  <p>
    3) Patient admitted with non-pressure ulcer that progresses to another
    severity level during the admission
  </p>
  <p>
    If a patient is admitted to an inpatient hospital with a non-pressure ulcer
    at one severity level and it progresses to a higher severity level, two
    separate codes should be assigned: one code for the site and severity level
    of the ulcer on admission and a second code for the same ulcer site and the
    highest severity level reported during the stay. See Section I.B.14 for
    pressure ulcer stage documentation by clinicians other than patient's
    provider

    13. Chapter 13: Diseases of the Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue (M00-M99)
  </h4>
  <p>a. Site and laterality</p>
  <p>
    Most of the codes within Chapter 13 have site and laterality designations.
    The site represents the bone, joint or the muscle involved. For some
    conditions where more than one bone, joint or muscle is usually involved,
    such as osteoarthritis, there is a “multiple sites” code available. For
    categories where no multiple site code is provided and more than one bone,
    joint or muscle is involved, multiple codes should be used to indicate the
    different sites involved.
  </p>
  <p>1) Bone versus joint</p>
  <p>
    For certain conditions, the bone may be affected at the upper or lower end,
    (e.g., avascular necrosis of bone, M87, Osteoporosis, M80, M81). Though the
    portion of the bone affected may be at the joint, the site designation will
    be the bone, not the joint.
  </p>
  <p>
    b. Acute traumatic versus chronic or recurrent musculoskeletal conditions
  </p>
  <p>
    Many musculoskeletal conditions are a result of previous injury or trauma to
    a site, or are recurrent conditions. Bone, joint or muscle conditions that
    are the result of a healed injury are usually found in chapter 13. Recurrent
    bone, joint or muscle conditions are also usually found in chapter 13. Any
    current, acute injury should be coded to the appropriate injury code from
    chapter 19. Chronic or recurrent conditions should generally be coded with a
    code from chapter 13. If it is difficult to determine from the documentation
    in the record which code is best to describe a condition, query the
    provider.
  </p>
  <p>c. Coding of Pathologic Fractures</p>
  <p>
    7th character A is for use as long as the patient is receiving active
    treatment for the fracture. While the patient may be seen by a new or
    different provider over the course of treatment for a pathological fracture,
    assignment of the 7th character is based on whether the patient is
    undergoing active treatment and not whether the provider is seeing the
    patient for the first time.
  </p>
  <p>
    7th character D is to be used for encounters after the patient has completed
    active treatment for the fracture and is receiving routine care for the
    fracture during the healing or recovery phase. The other 7th characters,
    listed under each subcategory in the Tabular List, are to be used for
    subsequent encounters for treatment of problems associated with the healing,
    such as malunions, nonunions, and sequelae. Care for complications of
    surgical treatment for fracture repairs during the healing or recovery phase
    should be coded with the appropriate complication codes. See Section I.C.19.

  <p>
    Osteoporosis is a systemic condition, meaning that all bones of the
    musculoskeletal system are affected. Therefore, site is not a component of
    the codes under category M81, Osteoporosis without current pathological
    fracture. The site codes under category M80, Osteoporosis with current
    pathological fracture, identify the site of the fracture, not the
    osteoporosis.
  </p>
  <p>1) Osteoporosis without pathological fracture</p>
  <p>
    Category M81, Osteoporosis without current pathological fracture, is for use
    for patients with osteoporosis who do not currently have a pathologic
    fracture due to the osteoporosis, even if they have had a fracture in the
    past. For patients with a history of osteoporosis fractures, status code
    Z87.310, Personal history of (healed) osteoporosis fracture, should follow
    the code from M81.
  </p>
  <p>2) Osteoporosis with current pathological fracture</p>
  <p>
    Category M80, Osteoporosis with current pathological fracture, is for
    patients who have a current pathologic fracture at the time of an encounter.
    The codes under M80 identify the site of the fracture. A code from category
    M80, not a traumatic fracture code, should be used for any patient with
    known osteoporosis who suffers a fracture, even if the patient had a minor
    fall or trauma, if that fall or trauma would not usually break a normal,
    healthy bone.

  <p>a. Chronic kidney disease</p>
  <p>1) Stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD)</p>
  <p>
    The ICD-10-CM classifies CKD based on severity. The severity of CKD is
    designated by stages 1-5. Stage 2, code N18.2, equates to mild CKD; stage 3,
    codes N18.30-N18.32, equate to moderate CKD; and stage 4, code N18.4,
    equates to severe CKD. Code N18.6, End stage renal disease (ESRD), is
    assigned when the provider has documented endstage renal disease (ESRD). If
    both a stage of CKD and ESRD are documented, assign code N18.6 only.
  </p>
  <p>2) Chronic kidney disease and kidney transplant status</p>
  <p>
    Patients who have undergone kidney transplant may still have some form of
    chronic kidney disease (CKD) because the kidney transplant may not fully
    restore kidney function. Therefore, the presence of CKD alone does not
    constitute a transplant complication. Assign the appropriate N18
  </p>
  <p>Page 58 of 115</p>
  <p>
    code for the patient’s stage of CKD and code Z94.0, Kidney transplant
    status. If a transplant complication such as failure or rejection or other
    transplant complication is documented, see section I.C.19.g for information
    on coding complications of a kidney transplant. If the documentation is
    unclear as to whether the patient has a complication of the transplant,
    query the provider.
  </p>
  <p>3) Chronic kidney disease with other conditions</p>
  <p>
    Patients with CKD may also suffer from other serious conditions, most
    commonly diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The sequencing of the CKD code
    in relationship to codes for other contributing conditions is based on the
    conventions in the Tabular List. See I.C.9. Hypertensive chronic kidney
    disease. See I.C.19. Chronic kidney disease and kidney transplant
    complications.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IC15">15. Chapter 15: Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Puerperium (O00-O9A)</h4>
  <p>a. General Rules for Obstetric Cases</p>
  <p>1) Codes from chapter 15 and sequencing priority</p>
  <p>
    Obstetric cases require codes from chapter 15, codes in the range O00O9A,
    Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Puerperium. Chapter 15 codes have sequencing
    priority over codes from other chapters. Additional codes from other
    chapters may be used in conjunction with chapter 15 codes to further specify
    conditions. Should the provider document that the pregnancy is incidental to
    the encounter, then code Z33.1, Pregnant state, incidental, should be used
    in place of any chapter 15 codes. It is the provider’s responsibility to
    state that the condition being treated is not affecting the pregnancy.
  </p>
  <p>2) Chapter 15 codes used only on the maternal record</p>
  <p>
    Chapter 15 codes are to be used only on the maternal record, never on the
    record of the newborn.
  </p>
  <p>3) Final character for trimester</p>
  <p>
    The majority of codes in Chapter 15 have a final character indicating the
    trimester of pregnancy. The timeframes for the trimesters are indicated at
    the beginning of the chapter. If trimester is not a component of a code, it
    is because the condition always occurs in a specific trimester, or the
    concept of trimester of pregnancy is not applicable. Certain codes have
    characters for only certain trimesters because the condition does not occur
    in all trimesters, but it may occur in more than just one. Assignment of the
    final character for trimester should be based on the provider’s
    documentation of the trimester (or number of weeks) for the current
    admission/encounter. This applies to the assignment of trimester
  </p>
  <p>Page 59 of 115</p>
  <p>
    for pre-existing conditions as well as those that develop during or are due
    to the pregnancy. The provider’s documentation of the number of weeks may be
    used to assign the appropriate code identifying the trimester. Whenever
    delivery occurs during the current admission, and there is an “in
    childbirth” option for the obstetric complication being coded, the “in
    childbirth” code should be assigned. When the classification does not
    provide an obstetric code with an “in childbirth” option, it is appropriate
    to assign a code describing the current trimester.
  </p>
  <p>
    4) Selection of trimester for inpatient admissions that encompass more than
    one trimester
  </p>
  <p>
    In instances when a patient is admitted to a hospital for complications of
    pregnancy during one trimester and remains in the hospital into a subsequent
    trimester, the trimester character for the antepartum complication code
    should be assigned on the basis of the trimester when the complication
    developed, not the trimester of the discharge. If the condition developed
    prior to the current admission/encounter or represents a pre-existing
    condition, the trimester character for the trimester at the time of the
    admission/encounter should be assigned.
  </p>
  <p>5) Unspecified trimester</p>
  <p>
    Each category that includes codes for trimester has a code for “unspecified
    trimester.” The “unspecified trimester” code should rarely be used, such as
    when the documentation in the record is insufficient to determine the
    trimester and it is not possible to obtain clarification.
  </p>
  <p>6) 7th character for Fetus Identification</p>
  <p>
    Where applicable, a 7th character is to be assigned for certain categories
    (O31, O32, O33.3 - O33.6, O35, O36, O40, O41, O60.1, O60.2, O64, and O69) to
    identify the fetus for which the complication code applies. Assign 7th
    character “0”: • For single gestations • When the documentation in the
    record is insufficient to determine the fetus affected and it is not
    possible to obtain clarification. • When it is not possible to clinically
    determine which fetus is affected.
  </p>
  <p>b. Selection of OB Principal or First-listed Diagnosis</p>
  <p>1) Routine outpatient prenatal visits</p>
  <p>
    For routine outpatient prenatal visits when no complications are present, a
    code from category Z34, Encounter for supervision of normal pregnancy,
    should be used as the first-listed diagnosis. These codes should not be used
    in conjunction with chapter 15 codes.
  </p>
  <p>2) Supervision of High-Risk Pregnancy</p>
  <p>Page 60 of 115</p>
  <p>
    Codes from category O09, Supervision of high-risk pregnancy, are intended
    for use only during the prenatal period. For complications during the labor
    or delivery episode as a result of a high-risk pregnancy, assign the
    applicable complication codes from Chapter 15. If there are no complications
    during the labor or delivery episode, assign code O80, Encounter for
    full-term uncomplicated delivery.
  </p>
  <p>
    For routine prenatal outpatient visits for patients with high-risk
    pregnancies, a code from category O09, Supervision of high-risk pregnancy,
    should be used as the first-listed diagnosis. Secondary chapter 15 codes may
    be used in conjunction with these codes if appropriate.
  </p>
  <p>3) Episodes when no delivery occurs</p>
  <p>
    In episodes when no delivery occurs, the principal diagnosis should
    correspond to the principal complication of the pregnancy which necessitated
    the encounter. Should more than one complication exist, all of which are
    treated or monitored, any of the complication codes may be sequenced first.
  </p>
  <p>4) When a delivery occurs</p>
  <p>
    When an obstetric patient is admitted and delivers during that admission,
    the condition that prompted the admission should be sequenced as the
    principal diagnosis. If multiple conditions prompted the admission, sequence
    the one most related to the delivery as the principal diagnosis. A code for
    any complication of the delivery should be assigned as an additional
    diagnosis. In cases of cesarean delivery, if the patient was admitted with a
    condition that resulted in the performance of a cesarean procedure, that
    condition should be selected as the principal diagnosis. If the reason for
    the admission was unrelated to the condition resulting in the cesarean
    delivery, the condition related to the reason for the admission should be
    selected as the principal diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>5) Outcome of delivery</p>
  <p>
    A code from category Z37, Outcome of delivery, should be included on every
    maternal record when a delivery has occurred. These codes are not to be used
    on subsequent records or on the newborn record.
  </p>
  <p>c. Pre-existing conditions versus conditions due to the pregnancy</p>
  <p>
    Certain categories in Chapter 15 distinguish between conditions of the
    mother that existed prior to pregnancy (pre-existing) and those that are a
    direct result of pregnancy. When assigning codes from Chapter 15, it is
    important to assess if a condition was pre-existing prior to pregnancy or
    developed during or due to the pregnancy in order to assign the correct
    code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Categories that do not distinguish between pre-existing and
    pregnancy-related conditions may be used for either. It is acceptable to use
    codes specifically for
  </p>
  <p>Page 61 of 115</p>
  <p>
    the puerperium with codes complicating pregnancy and childbirth if a
    condition arises postpartum during the delivery encounter.
  </p>
  <p>d. Pre-existing hypertension in pregnancy</p>
  <p>
    Category O10, Pre-existing hypertension complicating pregnancy, childbirth
    and the puerperium, includes codes for hypertensive heart and hypertensive
    chronic kidney disease. When assigning one of the O10 codes that includes
    hypertensive heart disease or hypertensive chronic kidney disease, it is
    necessary to add a secondary code from the appropriate hypertension category
    to specify the type of heart failure or chronic kidney disease. See Section
    I.C.9. Hypertension.
  </p>
  <p>e. Fetal Conditions Affecting the Management of the Mother</p>
  <p>1) Codes from categories O35 and O36</p>
  <p>
    Codes from categories O35, Maternal care for known or suspected fetal
    abnormality and damage, and O36, Maternal care for other fetal problems, are
    assigned only when the fetal condition is actually responsible for modifying
    the management of the mother, i.e., by requiring diagnostic studies,
    additional observation, special care, or termination of pregnancy. The fact
    that the fetal condition exists does not justify assigning a code from this
    series to the mother’s record.
  </p>
  <p>2) In utero surgery</p>
  <p>
    In cases when surgery is performed on the fetus, a diagnosis code from
    category O35, Maternal care for known or suspected fetal abnormality and
    damage, should be assigned identifying the fetal condition. Assign the
    appropriate procedure code for the procedure performed. No code from Chapter
    16, the perinatal codes, should be used on the mother’s record to identify
    fetal conditions. Surgery performed in utero on a fetus is still to be coded
    as an obstetric encounter.
  </p>
  <p>f. HIV Infection in Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Puerperium</p>
  <p>
    During pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium, a patient admitted because
    of an HIV-related illness should receive a principal diagnosis from
    subcategory O98.7-, Human immunodeficiency [HIV] disease complicating
    pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium, followed by the code(s) for the
    HIV-related illness(es).
  </p>
  <p>
    Patients with asymptomatic HIV infection status admitted during pregnancy,
    childbirth, or the puerperium should receive codes of O98.7- and Z21,
    Asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection status.
  </p>
  <p>g. Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy</p>
  <p>
    Diabetes mellitus is a significant complicating factor in pregnancy.
    Pregnant patients who are diabetic should be assigned a code from category
    O24,
  </p>
  <p>Page 62 of 115</p>
  <p>
    Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium, first,
    followed by the appropriate diabetes code(s) (E08-E13) from Chapter 4.
  </p>
  <p>h. Long term use of insulin and oral hypoglycemics</p>
  <p>
    See section I.C.4.a.3 for information on the long-term use of insulin and
    oral hypoglycemics.
  </p>
  <p>i. Gestational (pregnancy induced) diabetes</p>
  <p>
    Gestational (pregnancy induced) diabetes can occur during the second and
    third trimester of pregnancy in patients who were not diabetic prior to
    pregnancy. Gestational diabetes can cause complications in the pregnancy
    similar to those of pre-existing diabetes mellitus. It also puts the patient
    at greater risk of developing diabetes after the pregnancy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Codes for gestational diabetes are in subcategory O24.4, Gestational
    diabetes mellitus. No other code from category O24, Diabetes mellitus in
    pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium, should be used with a code from
    O24.4. The codes under subcategory O24.4 include diet controlled, insulin
    controlled, and controlled by oral hypoglycemic drugs. If a patient with
    gestational diabetes is treated with both diet and insulin, only the code
    for insulin-controlled is required. If a patient with gestational diabetes
    is treated with both diet and oral hypoglycemic medications, only the code
    for "controlled by oral hypoglycemic drugs" is required. Code Z79.4,
    Long-term (current) use of insulin or code Z79.84, Long-term (current) use
    of oral hypoglycemic drugs, should not be assigned with codes from
    subcategory O24.4.
  </p>
  <p>
    An abnormal glucose tolerance in pregnancy is assigned a code from
    subcategory O99.81, Abnormal glucose complicating pregnancy, childbirth, and
    the puerperium.
  </p>
  <p>
    j. Sepsis and septic shock complicating abortion, pregnancy, childbirth and
    the puerperium
  </p>
  <p>
    When assigning a chapter 15 code for sepsis complicating abortion,
    pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium, a code for the specific type of
    infection should be assigned as an additional diagnosis. If severe sepsis is
    present, a code from subcategory R65.2, Severe sepsis, and code(s) for
    associated organ dysfunction(s) should also be assigned as additional
    diagnoses.
  </p>
  <p>k. Puerperal sepsis</p>
  <p>
    Code O85, Puerperal sepsis, should be assigned with a secondary code to
    identify the causal organism (e.g., for a bacterial infection, assign a code
    from category B95-B96, Bacterial infections in conditions classified
    elsewhere). A code from category A40, Streptococcal sepsis, or A41, Other
    sepsis, should not be used for puerperal sepsis. If applicable, use
    additional codes to identify severe sepsis (R65.2-) and any associated acute
    organ dysfunction.
  </p>
  <p> Page 63 of 115</p>
  <p>
    Code O85 should not be assigned for sepsis following an obstetrical
    procedure (See Section I.C.1.d.5.b., Sepsis due to a postprocedural
    infection).
  </p>
  <p>
    l. Alcohol, tobacco and drug use during pregnancy, childbirth and the
    puerperium
  </p>
  <p>1) Alcohol use during pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium</p>
  <p>
    Codes under subcategory O99.31, Alcohol use complicating pregnancy,
    childbirth, and the puerperium, should be assigned for any pregnancy case
    when a patient uses alcohol during the pregnancy or postpartum. A secondary
    code from category F10, Alcohol related disorders, should also be assigned
    to identify manifestations of the alcohol use.
  </p>
  <p>2) Tobacco use during pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium</p>
  <p>
    Codes under subcategory O99.33, Smoking (tobacco) complicating pregnancy,
    childbirth, and the puerperium, should be assigned for any pregnancy case
    when a patient uses any type of tobacco product during the pregnancy or
    postpartum. A secondary code from category F17, Nicotine dependence, should
    also be assigned to identify the type of nicotine dependence.
  </p>
  <p>3) Drug use during pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium</p>
  <p>
    Codes under subcategory O99.32, Drug use complicating pregnancy, childbirth,
    and the puerperium, should be assigned for any pregnancy case when a patient
    uses drugs during the pregnancy or postpartum. This can involve illegal
    drugs, or inappropriate use or abuse of prescription drugs. Secondary
    code(s) from categories F11-F16 and F18-F19 should also be assigned to
    identify manifestations of the drug use.
  </p>
  <p>
    m. Poisoning, toxic effects, adverse effects and underdosing in a pregnant
    patient
  </p>
  <p>
    A code from subcategory O9A.2, Injury, poisoning and certain other
    consequences of external causes complicating pregnancy, childbirth, and the
    puerperium, should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate injury,
    poisoning, toxic effect, adverse effect or underdosing code, and then the
    additional code(s) that specifies the condition caused by the poisoning,
    toxic effect, adverse effect or underdosing. See Section I.C.19. Adverse
    effects, poisoning, underdosing and toxic effects.
  </p>
  <p>n. Normal Delivery, Code O80</p>
  <p>1) Encounter for full term uncomplicated delivery</p>
  <p>
    Code O80 should be assigned when a patient is admitted for a full-term
    normal delivery and delivers a single, healthy infant without any
    complications antepartum, during the delivery, or postpartum during the
    delivery episode. Code O80 is always a principal diagnosis. It is not to be
  </p>
  <p>Page 64 of 115</p>
  <p>
    used if any other code from chapter 15 is needed to describe a current
    complication of the antenatal, delivery, or postnatal period. Additional
    codes from other chapters may be used with code O80 if they are not related
    to or are in any way complicating the pregnancy.
  </p>
  <p>2) Uncomplicated delivery with resolved antepartum complication</p>
  <p>
    Code O80 may be used if the patient had a complication at some point during
    the pregnancy, but the complication is not present at the time of the
    admission for delivery.
  </p>
  <p>3) Outcome of delivery for O80</p>
  <p>
    Z37.0, Single live birth, is the only outcome of delivery code appropriate
    for use with O80.
  </p>
  <p>o. The Peripartum and Postpartum Periods</p>
  <p>1) Peripartum and Postpartum periods</p>
  <p>
    The postpartum period begins immediately after delivery and continues for
    six weeks following delivery. The peripartum period is defined as the last
    month of pregnancy to five months postpartum.
  </p>
  <p>2) Peripartum and postpartum complication</p>
  <p>
    A postpartum complication is any complication occurring within the sixweek
    period.
  </p>
  <p>3) Pregnancy-related complications after 6-week period</p>
  <p>
    Chapter 15 codes may also be used to describe pregnancy-related
    complications after the peripartum or postpartum period if the provider
    documents that a condition is pregnancy related.
  </p>
  <p>
    4) Admission for routine postpartum care following delivery outside hospital
  </p>
  <p>
    When the mother delivers outside the hospital prior to admission and is
    admitted for routine postpartum care and no complications are noted, code
    Z39.0, Encounter for care and examination of mother immediately after
    delivery, should be assigned as the principal diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>5) Pregnancy associated cardiomyopathy</p>
  <p>
    Pregnancy associated cardiomyopathy, code O90.3, is unique in that it may be
    diagnosed in the third trimester of pregnancy but may continue to progress
    months after delivery. For this reason, it is referred to as peripartum
    cardiomyopathy. Code O90.3 is only for use when the cardiomyopathy develops
    as a result of pregnancy in a patient who did not have pre-existing heart
    disease.
  </p>
  <p> Page 65 of 115</p>
  <p>
    p. Code O94, Sequelae of complication of pregnancy, childbirth, and the
    puerperium
  </p>
  <p>1) Code O94</p>
  <p>
    Code O94, Sequelae of complication of pregnancy, childbirth, and the
    puerperium, is for use in those cases when an initial complication of a
    pregnancy develops a sequela or sequelae requiring care or treatment at a
    future date.
  </p>
  <p>2) After the initial postpartum period</p>
  <p>This code may be used at any time after the initial postpartum period.</p>
  <p>3) Sequencing of Code O94</p>
  <p>
    This code, like all sequela codes, is to be sequenced following the code
    describing the sequelae of the complication.
  </p>
  <p>q. Termination of Pregnancy and Spontaneous abortions</p>
  <p>1) Abortion with Liveborn Fetus</p>
  <p>
    When an attempted termination of pregnancy results in a liveborn fetus,
    assign code Z33.2, Encounter for elective termination of pregnancy and a
    code from category Z37, Outcome of Delivery.
  </p>
  <p>2) Retained Products of Conception following an abortion</p>
  <p>
    Subsequent encounters for retained products of conception following a
    spontaneous abortion or elective termination of pregnancy, without
    complications are assigned O03.4, Incomplete spontaneous abortion without
    complication, or code O07.4, Failed attempted termination of pregnancy
    without complication. This advice is appropriate even when the patient was
    discharged previously with a discharge diagnosis of complete abortion. If
    the patient has a specific complication associated with the spontaneous
    abortion or elective termination of pregnancy in addition to retained
    products of conception, assign the appropriate complication code (e.g.,
    O03.-, O04.-, O07.-) instead of code O03.4 or O07.4.
  </p>
  <p>3) Complications leading to abortion</p>
  <p>
    Codes from Chapter 15 may be used as additional codes to identify any
    documented complications of the pregnancy in conjunction with codes in
    categories in O04, O07 and O08.
  </p>
  <p>r. Abuse in a pregnant patient</p>
  <p>
    For suspected or confirmed cases of abuse of a pregnant patient, a code(s)
    from subcategories O9A.3, Physical abuse complicating pregnancy, childbirth,
    and the puerperium, O9A.4, Sexual abuse complicating pregnancy, childbirth,
    and the puerperium, and O9A.5, Psychological abuse complicating pregnancy,
    childbirth, and the puerperium, should be sequenced first, followed by the
  </p>
  <p>Page 66 of 115</p>
  <p>
    appropriate codes (if applicable) to identify any associated current injury
    due to physical abuse, sexual abuse, and the perpetrator of abuse. See
    Section I.C.19. Adult and child abuse, neglect and other maltreatment.
  </p>
  <p>s. COVID-19 infection in pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium</p>
  <p>
    During pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium, when COVID-19 is the reason
    for admission/encounter , code O98.5-, Other viral diseases complicating
    pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium, should be sequenced as the
    principal/first-listed diagnosis, and code U07.1, COVID-19, and the
    appropriate codes for associated manifestation(s) should be assigned as
    additional diagnoses. Codes from Chapter 15 always take sequencing priority.
    If the reason for admission/encounter is unrelated to COVID-19 but the
    patient tests positive for COVID-19 during the admission/encounter, the
    appropriate code for the reason for admission/encounter should be sequenced
    as the principal/first-listed diagnosis, and codes O98.5- and U07.1, as well
    as the appropriate codes for associated COVID-19 manifestations, should be
    assigned as additional diagnoses.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IC16">
    16. Chapter 16: Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period (P00-P96)
  </h4>
  <p>
    For coding and reporting purposes the perinatal period is defined as before
    birth through the 28th day following birth. The following guidelines are
    provided for reporting purposes.
  </p>
  <p>a. General Perinatal Rules</p>
  <p>1) Use of Chapter 16 Codes</p>
  <p>
    Codes in this chapter are never for use on the maternal record. Codes from
    Chapter 15, the obstetric chapter, are never permitted on the newborn
    record. Chapter 16 codes may be used throughout the life of the patient if
    the condition is still present.
  </p>
  <p>2) Principal Diagnosis for Birth Record</p>
  <p>
    When coding the birth episode in a newborn record, assign a code from
    category Z38, Liveborn infants according to place of birth and type of
    delivery, as the principal diagnosis. A code from category Z38 is assigned
    only once, to a newborn at the time of birth. If a newborn is transferred to
    another institution, a code from category Z38 should not be used at the
    receiving hospital. A code from category Z38 is used only on the newborn
    record, not on the mother’s record.
  </p>
  <p>3) Use of Codes from other Chapters with Codes from Chapter 16</p>
  <p>Page 67 of 115</p>
  <p>
    Codes from other chapters may be used with codes from chapter 16 if the
    codes from the other chapters provide more specific detail. Codes for signs
    and symptoms may be assigned when a definitive diagnosis has not been
    established. If the reason for the encounter is a perinatal condition, the
    code from chapter 16 should be sequenced first.
  </p>
  <p>4) Use of Chapter 16 Codes after the Perinatal Period</p>
  <p>
    Should a condition originate in the perinatal period, and continue
    throughout the life of the patient, the perinatal code should continue to be
    used regardless of the patient’s age.
  </p>
  <p>5) Birth process or community acquired conditions</p>
  <p>
    If a newborn has a condition that may be either due to the birth process or
    community acquired and the documentation does not indicate which it is, the
    default is due to the birth process and the code from Chapter 16 should be
    used. If the condition is community-acquired, a code from Chapter 16 should
    not be assigned. For COVID-19 infection in a newborn, see guideline
    I.C.16.h.
  </p>
  <p>6) Code all clinically significant conditions</p>
  <p>
    All clinically significant conditions noted on routine newborn examination
    should be coded. A condition is clinically significant if it requires: 
    clinical evaluation; or  therapeutic treatment; or  diagnostic procedures;
    or  extended length of hospital stay; or  increased nursing care and/or
    monitoring; or  has implications for future health care needs
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: The perinatal guidelines listed above are the same as the general
    coding guidelines for “additional diagnoses,” except for the final point
    regarding implications for future health care needs. Codes should be
    assigned for conditions that have been specified by the provider as having
    implications for future health care needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    b. Observation and Evaluation of Newborns for Suspected Conditions not Found
  </p>
  <p>1) Use of Z05 codes</p>
  <p>
    Assign a code from category Z05, Observation and evaluation of newborns and
    infants for suspected conditions ruled out, to identify those instances when
    a healthy newborn is evaluated for a suspected condition that is determined
    after study not to be present. Do not use a code from category Z05 when the
    patient has identified signs or symptoms of a suspected problem; in such
    cases code the sign or symptom.
  </p>
  <p>Page 68 of 115</p>
  <p>2) Z05 on other than the birth record</p>
  <p>
    A code from category Z05 may also be assigned as a principal or firstlisted
    code for readmissions or encounters when the code from category Z38 code no
    longer applies. Codes from category Z05 are for use only for healthy
    newborns and infants for which no condition after study is found to be
    present.
  </p>
  <p>3) Z05 on a birth record</p>
  <p>
    A code from category Z05 is to be used as a secondary code after the code
    from category Z38, Liveborn infants according to place of birth and type of
    delivery.
  </p>
  <p>c. Coding Additional Perinatal Diagnoses</p>
  <p>1) Assigning codes for conditions that require treatment</p>
  <p>
    Assign codes for conditions that require treatment or further investigation,
    prolong the length of stay, or require resource utilization.
  </p>
  <p>
    2) Codes for conditions specified as having implications for future health
    care needs
  </p>
  <p>
    Assign codes for conditions that have been specified by the provider as
    having implications for future health care needs. Note: This guideline
    should not be used for adult patients.
  </p>
  <p>d. Prematurity and Fetal Growth Retardation</p>
  <p>
    Providers utilize different criteria in determining prematurity. A code for
    prematurity should not be assigned unless it is documented. Assignment of
    codes in categories P05, Disorders of newborn related to slow fetal growth
    and fetal malnutrition, and P07, Disorders of newborn related to short
    gestation and low birth weight, not elsewhere classified, should be based on
    the recorded birth weight and estimated gestational age. When both birth
    weight and gestational age are available, two codes from category P07 should
    be assigned, with the code for birth weight sequenced before the code for
    gestational age.
  </p>
  <p>e. Low birth weight and immaturity status</p>
  <p>
    Codes from category P07, Disorders of newborn related to short gestation and
    low birth weight, not elsewhere classified, are for use for a child or adult
    who was premature or had a low birth weight as a newborn and this is
    affecting the patient’s current health status. See Section I.C.21. Factors
    influencing health status and contact with health services, Status.
  </p>
  <p> Page 69 of 115</p>
  <p>f. Bacterial Sepsis of Newborn</p>
  <p>
    Category P36, Bacterial sepsis of newborn, includes congenital sepsis. If a
    perinate is documented as having sepsis without documentation of congenital
    or community acquired, the default is congenital and a code from category
    P36 should be assigned. If the P36 code includes the causal organism, an
    additional code from category B95, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and
    Enterococcus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere, or B96, Other
    bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere, should not
    be assigned. If the P36 code does not include the causal organism, assign an
    additional code from category B96. If applicable, use additional codes to
    identify severe sepsis (R65.2-) and any associated acute organ dysfunction.
  </p>
  <p>g. Stillbirth</p>
  <p>
    Code P95, Stillbirth, is only for use in institutions that maintain separate
    records for stillbirths. No other code should be used with P95. Code P95
    should not be used on the mother’s record.
  </p>
  <p>h. COVID-19 Infection in Newborn</p>
  <p>
    For a newborn that tests positive for COVID-19, assign code U07.1, COVID-19,
    and the appropriate codes for associated manifestation(s) in
    neonates/newborns in the absence of documentation indicating a specific type
    of transmission. For a newborn that tests positive for COVID-19 and the
    provider documents the condition was contracted in utero or during the birth
    process, assign codes P35.8, Other congenital viral diseases, and U07.1,
    COVID-19. When coding the birth episode in a newborn record, the appropriate
    code from category Z38, Liveborn infants according to place of birth and
    type of delivery, should be assigned as the principal diagnosis.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IC17">
    17. Chapter 17: Congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities (Q00-Q99)
  </h4>
  <p>
    Assign an appropriate code(s) from categories Q00-Q99, Congenital
    malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities when a
    malformation/deformation or chromosomal abnormality is documented. A
    malformation/deformation/or chromosomal abnormality may be the
    principal/first-listed diagnosis on a record or a secondary diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a malformation/deformation or chromosomal abnormality does not have a
    unique code assignment, assign additional code(s) for any manifestations
    that may be present. When the code assignment specifically identifies the
    malformation/deformation or chromosomal abnormality, manifestations that are
    an inherent component of the anomaly should not be coded separately.
    Additional codes should be assigned for manifestations that are not an
    inherent component.
  </p>
  <p>
    Codes from Chapter 17 may be used throughout the life of the patient. If a
    congenital malformation or deformity has been corrected, a personal history
    code should be used to identify the history of the malformation or
    deformity. Although present at birth, a malformation/deformation/or
    chromosomal abnormality may not be identified until later
  </p>
  <p>Page 70 of 115</p>
  <p>
    in life. Whenever the condition is diagnosed by the provider, it is
    appropriate to assign a code from codes Q00-Q99. For the birth admission,
    the appropriate code from category Z38, Liveborn infants, according to place
    of birth and type of delivery, should be sequenced as the principal
    diagnosis, followed by any congenital anomaly codes, Q00Q99.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IC18">
    18. Chapter 18: Symptoms, signs, and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified (R00-R99)
  </h4>
  <p>
    Chapter 18 includes symptoms, signs, abnormal results of clinical or other
    investigative procedures, and ill-defined conditions regarding which no
    diagnosis classifiable elsewhere is recorded. Signs and symptoms that point
    to a specific diagnosis have been assigned to a category in other chapters
    of the classification.
  </p>
  <p>a. Use of symptom codes</p>
  <p>
    Codes that describe symptoms and signs are acceptable for reporting purposes
    when a related definitive diagnosis has not been established (confirmed) by
    the provider.
  </p>
  <p>b. Use of a symptom code with a definitive diagnosis code</p>
  <p>
    Codes for signs and symptoms may be reported in addition to a related
    definitive diagnosis when the sign or symptom is not routinely associated
    with that diagnosis, such as the various signs and symptoms associated with
    complex syndromes. The definitive diagnosis code should be sequenced before
    the symptom code. Signs or symptoms that are associated routinely with a
    disease process should not be assigned as additional codes, unless otherwise
    instructed by the classification.
  </p>
  <p>c. Combination codes that include symptoms</p>
  <p>
    ICD-10-CM contains a number of combination codes that identify both the
    definitive diagnosis and common symptoms of that diagnosis. When using one
    of these combination codes, an additional code should not be assigned for
    the symptom.
  </p>
  <p>d. Repeated falls</p>
  <p>
    Code R29.6, Repeated falls, is for use for encounters when a patient has
    recently fallen and the reason for the fall is being investigated. Code
    Z91.81, History of falling, is for use when a patient has fallen in the past
    and is at risk for future falls. When appropriate, both codes R29.6 and
    Z91.81 may be assigned together.
  </p>
  <p>e. Coma</p>
  <p>
    Code R40.20, Unspecified coma, may be assigned in conjunction with codes for
    any medical condition.
  </p>
  <p> Page 71 of 115</p>
  <p>
    Do not report codes for unspecified coma, individual or total Glasgow coma
    scale scores for a patient with a medically induced coma or a sedated
    patient.
  </p>
  <p>1) Coma Scale</p>
  <p>
    The coma scale codes (R40.21- to R40.24-) can be used in conjunction with
    traumatic brain injury codes. These codes are primarily for use by trauma
    registries, but they may be used in any setting where this information is
    collected. The coma scale codes should be sequenced after the diagnosis
    code(s).
  </p>
  <p>
    These codes, one from each subcategory, are needed to complete the scale.
    The 7th character indicates when the scale was recorded. The 7th character
    should match for all three codes.
  </p>
  <p>
    At a minimum, report the initial score documented on presentation at your
    facility. This may be a score from the emergency medicine technician (EMT)
    or in the emergency department. If desired, a facility may choose to capture
    multiple coma scale scores. Assign code R40.24-, Glasgow coma scale, total
    score, when only the total score is documented in the medical record and not
    the individual score(s).
  </p>
  <p>
    If multiple coma scores are captured within the first 24 hours after
    hospital admission, assign only the code for the score at the time of
    admission. ICD-10-CM does not classify coma scores that are reported after
    admission but less than 24 hours later. See Section I.B.14 for coma scale
    documentation by clinicians other than patient's provider

    f. Functional quadriplegia GUIDELINE HAS BEEN DELETED EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1,
    2017
  </p>
  <p>g. SIRS due to Non-Infectious Process</p>
  <p>
    The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) can develop as a result
    of certain non-infectious disease processes, such as trauma, malignant
    neoplasm, or pancreatitis. When SIRS is documented with a noninfectious
    condition, and no subsequent infection is documented, the code for the
    underlying condition, such as an injury, should be assigned, followed by
    code R65.10, Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) of
    non-infectious origin without acute organ dysfunction, or code R65.11,
    Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) of non-infectious origin with
    acute organ dysfunction. If an associated acute organ dysfunction is
    documented, the appropriate code(s) for the specific type of organ
    dysfunction(s) should be assigned in addition to code R65.11. If acute organ
    dysfunction is documented, but it cannot be determined if the acute
  </p>
  <p>Page 72 of 115</p>
  <p>
    organ dysfunction is associated with SIRS or due to another condition (e.g.,
    directly due to the trauma), the provider should be queried.
  </p>
  <p>h. Death NOS</p>
  <p>
    Code R99, Ill-defined and unknown cause of mortality, is only for use in the
    very limited circumstance when a patient who has already died is brought
    into an emergency department or other healthcare facility and is pronounced
    dead upon arrival. It does not represent the discharge disposition of death.
  </p>
  <p>i. NIHSS Stroke Scale</p>
  <p>
    The NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) codes (R29.7- -) can be used in conjunction
    with acute stroke codes (I63) to identify the patient's neurological status
    and the severity of the stroke. The stroke scale codes should be sequenced
    after the acute stroke diagnosis code(s). At a minimum, report the initial
    score documented. If desired, a facility may choose to capture multiple
    stroke scale scores. See Section I.B.14 for NIHSS stroke scale documentation
    by clinicians other than patient's provider
  </p>
  <h4 id="IC19">
    19. Chapter 19: Injury, poisoning, and certain other consequences of
    external causes (S00-T88)
  </h4>
  <p>a. Application of 7th Characters in Chapter 19</p>
  <p>
    Most categories in chapter 19 have a 7th character requirement for each
    applicable code. Most categories in this chapter have three 7th character
    values (with the exception of fractures): A, initial encounter, D,
    subsequent encounter and S, sequela. Categories for traumatic fractures have
    additional 7th character values. While the patient may be seen by a new or
    different provider over the course of treatment for an injury, assignment of
    the 7th character is based on whether the patient is undergoing active
    treatment and not whether the provider is seeing the patient for the first
    time.
  </p>
  <p>
    For complication codes, active treatment refers to treatment for the
    condition described by the code, even though it may be related to an earlier
    precipitating problem. For example, code T84.50XA, Infection and
    inflammatory reaction due to unspecified internal joint prosthesis, initial
    encounter, is used when active treatment is provided for the infection, even
    though the condition relates to the prosthetic device, implant or graft that
    was placed at a previous encounter. 7th character “A”, initial encounter is
    used for each encounter where the patient is receiving active treatment for
    the condition.
  </p>
  <p>
    7th character “D” subsequent encounter is used for encounters after the
    patient has completed active treatment of the condition and is receiving
    routine care for the condition during the healing or recovery phase.
  </p>
  <p>Page 73 of 115</p>
  <p>
    The aftercare Z codes should not be used for aftercare for conditions such
    as injuries or poisonings, where 7th characters are provided to identify
    subsequent care. For example, for aftercare of an injury, assign the acute
    injury code with the 7th character “D” (subsequent encounter).
  </p>
  <p>
    7th character “S”, sequela, is for use for complications or conditions that
    arise as a direct result of a condition, such as scar formation after a
    burn. The scars are sequelae of the burn. When using 7th character “S”, it
    is necessary to use both the injury code that precipitated the sequela and
    the code for the sequela itself. The “S” is added only to the injury code,
    not the sequela code. The 7th character “S” identifies the injury
    responsible for the sequela. The specific type of sequela (e.g. scar) is
    sequenced first, followed by the injury code. See Section I.B.10 Sequelae,
    (Late Effects)
  </p>
  <p>b. Coding of Injuries</p>
  <p>
    When coding injuries, assign separate codes for each injury unless a
    combination code is provided, in which case the combination code is
    assigned. Codes from category T07, Unspecified multiple injuries should not
    be assigned in the inpatient setting unless information for a more specific
    code is not available. Traumatic injury codes (S00- T14.9) are not to be
    used for normal, healing surgical wounds or to identify complications of
    surgical wounds. The code for the most serious injury, as determined by the
    provider and the focus of treatment, is sequenced first.
  </p>
  <p>1) Superficial injuries</p>
  <p>
    Superficial injuries such as abrasions or contusions are not coded when
    associated with more severe injuries of the same site.
  </p>
  <p>2) Primary injury with damage to nerves/blood vessels</p>
  <p>
    When a primary injury results in minor damage to peripheral nerves or blood
    vessels, the primary injury is sequenced first with additional code(s) for
    injuries to nerves and spinal cord (such as category S04), and/or injury to
    blood vessels (such as category S15). When the primary injury is to the
    blood vessels or nerves, that injury should be sequenced first.
  </p>
  <p>3) Iatrogenic injuries</p>
  <p>
    Injury codes from Chapter 19 should not be assigned for injuries that occur
    during, or as a result of, a medical intervention. Assign the appropriate
    complication code(s).
  </p>
  <p>c. Coding of Traumatic Fractures</p>
  <p>
    The principles of multiple coding of injuries should be followed in coding
    fractures. Fractures of specified sites are coded individually by site in
    accordance with both the provisions within categories S02, S12, S22, S32,
    S42,
  </p>
  <p>Page 74 of 115</p>
  <p>
    S49, S52, S59, S62, S72, S79, S82, S89, S92 and the level of detail
    furnished by medical record content. A fracture not indicated as open or
    closed should be coded to closed. A fracture not indicated whether displaced
    or not displaced should be coded to displaced. More specific guidelines are
    as follows:
  </p>
  <p>1) Initial vs. subsequent encounter for fractures</p>
  <p>
    Traumatic fractures are coded using the appropriate 7th character for
    initial encounter (A, B, C) for each encounter where the patient is
    receiving active treatment for the fracture. The appropriate 7th character
    for initial encounter should also be assigned for a patient who delayed
    seeking treatment for the fracture or nonunion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fractures are coded using the appropriate 7th character for subsequent care
    for encounters after the patient has completed active treatment of the
    fracture and is receiving routine care for the fracture during the healing
    or recovery phase.
  </p>
  <p>
    Care for complications of surgical treatment for fracture repairs during the
    healing or recovery phase should be coded with the appropriate complication
    codes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Care of complications of fractures, such as malunion and nonunion, should be
    reported with the appropriate 7th character for subsequent care with
    nonunion (K, M, N,) or subsequent care with malunion (P, Q, R).
    Malunion/nonunion: The appropriate 7th character for initial encounter
    should also be assigned for a patient who delayed seeking treatment for the
    fracture or nonunion.
  </p>
  <p>
    The open fracture designations in the assignment of the 7th character for
    fractures of the forearm, femur and lower leg, including ankle are based on
    the Gustilo open fracture classification. When the Gustilo classification
    type is not specified for an open fracture, the 7th character for open
    fracture type I or II should be assigned (B, E, H, M, Q). A code from
    category M80, not a traumatic fracture code, should be used for any patient
    with known osteoporosis who suffers a fracture, even if the patient had a
    minor fall or trauma, if that fall or trauma would not usually break a
    normal, healthy bone.
  </p>
  <p>
    See Section I.C.13. Osteoporosis. The aftercare Z codes should not be used
    for aftercare for traumatic fractures. For aftercare of a traumatic
    fracture, assign the acute fracture code with the appropriate 7th character.
  </p>
  <p>Page 75 of 115</p>
  <p>2) Multiple fractures sequencing</p>
  <p>
    Multiple fractures are sequenced in accordance with the severity of the
    fracture.
  </p>
  <p>3) Physeal fractures</p>
  <p>
    For physeal fractures, assign only the code identifying the type of physeal
    fracture. Do not assign a separate code to identify the specific bone that
    is fractured.
  </p>
  <p>d. Coding of Burns and Corrosions</p>
  <p>
    The ICD-10-CM makes a distinction between burns and corrosions. The burn
    codes are for thermal burns, except sunburns, that come from a heat source,
    such as a fire or hot appliance. The burn codes are also for burns resulting
    from electricity and radiation. Corrosions are burns due to chemicals. The
    guidelines are the same for burns and corrosions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Current burns (T20-T25) are classified by depth, extent and by agent (X
    code). Burns are classified by depth as first degree (erythema), second
    degree (blistering), and third degree (full-thickness involvement). Burns of
    the eye and internal organs (T26-T28) are classified by site, but not by
    degree.
  </p>
  <p>1) Sequencing of burn and related condition codes</p>
  <p>
    Sequence first the code that reflects the highest degree of burn when more
    than one burn is present.
  </p>
  <p>
    a. When the reason for the admission or encounter is for treatment of
    external multiple burns, sequence first the code that reflects the burn of
    the highest degree.
  </p>
  <p>
    b. When a patient has both internal and external burns, the circumstances of
    admission govern the selection of the principal diagnosis or first-listed
    diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    c. When a patient is admitted for burn injuries and other related conditions
    such as smoke inhalation and/or respiratory failure, the circumstances of
    admission govern the selection of the principal or first-listed diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>2) Burns of the same anatomic site</p>
  <p>
    Classify burns of the same anatomic site and on the same side but of
    different degrees to the subcategory identifying the highest degree recorded
    in the diagnosis (e.g., for second and third degree burns of right thigh,
    assign only code T24.311-).
  </p>
  <p>3) Non-healing burns</p>
  <p>
    Non-healing burns are coded as acute burns. Necrosis of burned skin should
    be coded as a non-healed burn.
  </p>
  <p>Page 76 of 115</p>
  <p>4) Infected burn</p>
  <p>
    For any documented infected burn site, use an additional code for the
    infection.
  </p>
  <p>5) Assign separate codes for each burn site</p>
  <p>
    When coding burns, assign separate codes for each burn site. Category T30,
    Burn and corrosion, body region unspecified is extremely vague and should
    rarely be used. Codes for burns of "multiple sites" should only be assigned
    when the medical record documentation does not specify the individual sites.
  </p>
  <p>
    6) Burns and corrosions classified according to extent of body surface
    involved
  </p>
  <p>
    Assign codes from category T31, Burns classified according to extent of body
    surface involved, or T32, Corrosions classified according to extent of body
    surface involved, for acute burns or corrosions when the site of the burn or
    corrosion is not specified or when there is a need for additional data. It
    is advisable to use category T31 as additional coding when needed to provide
    data for evaluating burn mortality, such as that needed by burn units. It is
    also advisable to use category T31 as an additional code for reporting
    purposes when there is mention of a thirddegree burn involving 20 percent or
    more of the body surface. Codes from categories T31 and T32 should not be
    used for sequelae of burns or corrosions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Categories T31 and T32 are based on the classic “rule of nines” in
    estimating body surface involved: head and neck are assigned nine percent,
    each arm nine percent, each leg 18 percent, the anterior trunk 18 percent,
    posterior trunk 18 percent, and genitalia one percent. Providers may change
    these percentage assignments where necessary to accommodate infants and
    children who have proportionately larger heads than adults, and patients who
    have large buttocks, thighs, or abdomen that involve burns.
  </p>
  <p>7) Encounters for treatment of sequela of burns</p>
  <p>
    Encounters for the treatment of the late effects of burns or corrosions
    (i.e., scars or joint contractures) should be coded with a burn or corrosion
    code with the 7th character “S” for sequela.
  </p>
  <p>8) Sequelae with a late effect code and current burn</p>
  <p>
    When appropriate, both a code for a current burn or corrosion with 7th
    character “A” or “D” and a burn or corrosion code with 7th character “S” may
    be assigned on the same record (when both a current burn and sequelae of an
    old burn exist). Burns and corrosions do not heal at the same rate and a
    current healing wound may still exist with sequela of a healed burn or
    corrosion.
  </p>
  <p>Page 77 of 115</p>
  <p>See Section I.B.10 Sequela (Late Effects)</p>
  <p>9) Use of an external cause code with burns and corrosions</p>
  <p>
    An external cause code should be used with burns and corrosions to identify
    the source and intent of the burn, as well as the place where it occurred.
  </p>
  <p>
    e. Adverse Effects, Poisoning, Underdosing and Toxic Effects Codes in
    categories T36-T65 are combination codes that include the substance that was
    taken as well as the intent. No additional external cause code is required
    for poisonings, toxic effects, adverse effects and underdosing codes.
  </p>
  <p>1) Do not code directly from the Table of Drugs</p>
  <p>
    Do not code directly from the Table of Drugs and Chemicals. Always refer
    back to the Tabular List.
  </p>
  <p>2) Use as many codes as necessary to describe</p>
  <p>
    Use as many codes as necessary to describe completely all drugs, medicinal
    or biological substances.
  </p>
  <p>3) If the same code would describe the causative agent</p>
  <p>
    If the same code would describe the causative agent for more than one
    adverse reaction, poisoning, toxic effect or underdosing, assign the code
    only once.
  </p>
  <p>4) If two or more drugs, medicinal or biological substances</p>
  <p>
    If two or more drugs, medicinal or biological substances are taken, code
    each individually unless a combination code is listed in the Table of Drugs
    and Chemicals. If multiple unspecified drugs, medicinal or biological
    substances were taken, assign the appropriate code from subcategory T50.91,
    Poisoning by, adverse effect of and underdosing of multiple unspecified
    drugs, medicaments and biological substances.
  </p>
  <p>
    5) The occurrence of drug toxicity is classified in ICD-10-CM as follows:
    (a) Adverse Effect
  </p>
  <p>
    When coding an adverse effect of a drug that has been correctly prescribed
    and properly administered, assign the appropriate code for the nature of the
    adverse effect followed by the appropriate code for the adverse effect of
    the drug (T36-T50). The code for the drug should have a 5th or 6th character
    “5” (for example T36.0X5-) Examples of the nature of an adverse effect are
    tachycardia, delirium, gastrointestinal hemorrhaging, vomiting, hypokalemia,
    hepatitis, renal failure, or respiratory failure.
  </p>
  <p>Page 78 of 115</p>
  <p>(b) Poisoning</p>
  <p>
    When coding a poisoning or reaction to the improper use of a medication
    (e.g., overdose, wrong substance given or taken in error, wrong route of
    administration), first assign the appropriate code from categories T36-T50.
    The poisoning codes have an associated intent as their 5th or 6th character
    (accidental, intentional self-harm, assault and undetermined). If the intent
    of the poisoning is unknown or unspecified, code the intent as accidental
    intent. The undetermined intent is only for use if the documentation in the
    record specifies that the intent cannot be determined. Use additional
    code(s) for all manifestations of poisonings.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there is also a diagnosis of abuse or dependence of the substance, the
    abuse or dependence is assigned as an additional code. Examples of poisoning
    include:
  </p>
  <p>(i) Error was made in drug prescription</p>
  <p>
    Errors made in drug prescription or in the administration of the drug by
    provider, nurse, patient, or other person.
  </p>
  <p>(ii) Overdose of a drug intentionally taken</p>
  <p>
    If an overdose of a drug was intentionally taken or administered and
    resulted in drug toxicity, it would be coded as a poisoning.
    (iii)Nonprescribed drug taken with correctly prescribed and properly
    administered drug
  </p>
  <p>
    If a nonprescribed drug or medicinal agent was taken in combination with a
    correctly prescribed and properly administered drug, any drug toxicity or
    other reaction resulting from the interaction of the two drugs would be
    classified as a poisoning. (iv) Interaction of drug(s) and alcohol
  </p>
  <p>
    When a reaction results from the interaction of a drug(s) and alcohol, this
    would be classified as poisoning. See Section I.C.4. if poisoning is the
    result of insulin pump malfunctions.
  </p>
  <p>(c) Underdosing</p>
  <p>
    Underdosing refers to taking less of a medication than is prescribed by a
    provider or a manufacturer’s instruction. Discontinuing the use of a
    prescribed medication on the patient's own initiative (not directed by the
    patient's provider) is also
  </p>
  <p>Page 79 of 115</p>
  <p>
    classified as an underdosing. For underdosing, assign the code from
    categories T36-T50 (fifth or sixth character “6”). Codes for underdosing
    should never be assigned as principal or first-listed codes. If a patient
    has a relapse or exacerbation of the medical condition for which the drug is
    prescribed because of the reduction in dose, then the medical condition
    itself should be coded.
  </p>
  <p>
    Noncompliance (Z91.12-, Z91.13- and Z91.14-) or complication of care
    (Y63.6-Y63.9) codes are to be used with an underdosing code to indicate
    intent, if known. (d) Toxic Effects
  </p>
  <p>
    When a harmful substance is ingested or comes in contact with a person, this
    is classified as a toxic effect. The toxic effect codes are in categories
    T51-T65. Toxic effect codes have an associated intent: accidental,
    intentional self-harm, assault and undetermined.
  </p>
  <p>f. Adult and child abuse, neglect and other maltreatment</p>
  <p>
    Sequence first the appropriate code from categories T74, Adult and child
    abuse, neglect and other maltreatment, confirmed, or T76, Adult and child
    abuse, neglect and other maltreatment, suspected, for abuse, neglect and
    other maltreatment, followed by any accompanying mental health or injury
    code(s). If the documentation in the medical record states abuse or neglect,
    it is coded as confirmed (T74.-). It is coded as suspected if it is
    documented as suspected (T76.-).
  </p>
  <p>
    For cases of confirmed abuse or neglect an external cause code from the
    assault section (X92-Y09) should be added to identify the cause of any
    physical injuries. A perpetrator code (Y07) should be added when the
    perpetrator of the abuse is known. For suspected cases of abuse or neglect,
    do not report external cause or perpetrator code.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a suspected case of abuse, neglect or mistreatment is ruled out during an
    encounter code Z04.71, Encounter for examination and observation following
    alleged physical adult abuse, ruled out, or code Z04.72, Encounter for
    examination and observation following alleged child physical abuse, ruled
    out, should be used, not a code from T76.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a suspected case of alleged rape or sexual abuse is ruled out during an
    encounter code Z04.41, Encounter for examination and observation following
    alleged adult rape or code Z04.42, Encounter for examination and observation
    following alleged child rape, should be used, not a code from T76.
  </p>
  <p> Page 80 of 115</p>
  <p>
    If a suspected case of forced sexual exploitation or forced labor
    exploitation is ruled out during an encounter, code Z04.81, Encounter for
    examination and observation of victim following forced sexual exploitation,
    or code Z04.82, Encounter for examination and observation of victim
    following forced labor exploitation, should be used, not a code from T76.
    See Section I.C.15. Abuse in a pregnant patient.
  </p>
  <p>g. Complications of care</p>
  <p>1) General guidelines for complications of care</p>
  <p>
    (a) Documentation of complications of care See Section I.B.16. for
    information on documentation of complications of care.
  </p>
  <p>2) Pain due to medical devices</p>
  <p>
    Pain associated with devices, implants or grafts left in a surgical site
    (for example painful hip prosthesis) is assigned to the appropriate code(s)
    found in Chapter 19, Injury, poisoning, and certain other consequences of
    external causes. Specific codes for pain due to medical devices are found in
    the T code section of the ICD-10-CM. Use additional code(s) from category
    G89 to identify acute or chronic pain due to presence of the device, implant
    or graft (G89.18 or G89.28).
  </p>
  <p>3) Transplant complications</p>
  <p>(a) Transplant complications other than kidney</p>
  <p>
    Codes under category T86, Complications of transplanted organs and tissues,
    are for use for both complications and rejection of transplanted organs. A
    transplant complication code is only assigned if the complication affects
    the function of the transplanted organ. Two codes are required to fully
    describe a transplant complication: the appropriate code from category T86
    and a secondary code that identifies the complication. Pre-existing
    conditions or conditions that develop after the transplant are not coded as
    complications unless they affect the function of the transplanted organs.
    See I.C.21. for transplant organ removal status See I.C.2. for malignant
    neoplasm associated with transplanted organ.
  </p>
  <p>(b) Kidney transplant complications</p>
  <p>
    Patients who have undergone kidney transplant may still have some form of
    chronic kidney disease (CKD) because the kidney
  </p>
  <p>Page 81 of 115</p>
  <p>
    transplant may not fully restore kidney function. Code T86.1should be
    assigned for documented complications of a kidney transplant, such as
    transplant failure or rejection or other transplant complication. Code
    T86.1- should not be assigned for post kidney transplant patients who have
    chronic kidney (CKD) unless a transplant complication such as transplant
    failure or rejection is documented. If the documentation is unclear as to
    whether the patient has a complication of the transplant, query the
    provider.
  </p>
  <p>
    Conditions that affect the function of the transplanted kidney, other than
    CKD, should be assigned a code from subcategory T86.1, Complications of
    transplanted organ, Kidney, and a secondary code that identifies the
    complication. For patients with CKD following a kidney transplant, but who
    do not have a complication such as failure or rejection, see section I.C.14.
    Chronic kidney disease and kidney transplant status.
  </p>
  <p>4) Complication codes that include the external cause</p>
  <p>
    As with certain other T codes, some of the complications of care codes have
    the external cause included in the code. The code includes the nature of the
    complication as well as the type of procedure that caused the complication.
    No external cause code indicating the type of procedure is necessary for
    these codes.
  </p>
  <p>5) Complications of care codes within the body system chapters</p>
  <p>
    Intraoperative and postprocedural complication codes are found within the
    body system chapters with codes specific to the organs and structures of
    that body system. These codes should be sequenced first, followed by a
    code(s) for the specific complication, if applicable. Complication codes
    from the body system chapters should be assigned for intraoperative and
    postprocedural complications (e.g., the appropriate complication code from
    chapter 9 would be assigned for a vascular intraoperative or postprocedural
    complication) unless the complication is specifically indexed to a T code in
    chapter 19.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IC20">20. Chapter 20: External Causes of Morbidity (V00-Y99)</h4>
  <p>
    The external causes of morbidity codes should never be sequenced as the
    first-listed or principal diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    External cause codes are intended to provide data for injury research and
    evaluation of injury prevention strategies. These codes capture how the
    injury or health condition happened (cause), the intent (unintentional or
    accidental; or intentional, such as suicide or assault), the place where the
    event occurred the activity of the patient at the time of the event, and the
    person’s status (e.g., civilian, military).
  </p>
  <p> Page 82 of 115</p>
  <p>
    There is no national requirement for mandatory ICD-10-CM external cause code
    reporting. Unless a provider is subject to a state-based external cause code
    reporting mandate or these codes are required by a particular payer,
    reporting of ICD-10-CM codes in Chapter 20, External Causes of Morbidity, is
    not required. In the absence of a mandatory reporting requirement, providers
    are encouraged to voluntarily report external cause codes, as they provide
    valuable data for injury research and evaluation of injury prevention
    strategies.
  </p>
  <p>a. General External Cause Coding Guidelines</p>
  <p>1) Used with any code in the range of A00.0-T88.9, Z00-Z99</p>
  <p>
    An external cause code may be used with any code in the range of
    A00.0-T88.9, Z00-Z99, classification that represents a health condition due
    to an external cause. Though they are most applicable to injuries, they are
    also valid for use with such things as infections or diseases due to an
    external source, and other health conditions, such as a heart attack that
    occurs during strenuous physical activity.
  </p>
  <p>2) External cause code used for length of treatment</p>
  <p>
    Assign the external cause code, with the appropriate 7th character (initial
    encounter, subsequent encounter or sequela) for each encounter for which the
    injury or condition is being treated.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most categories in chapter 20 have a 7th character requirement for each
    applicable code. Most categories in this chapter have three 7th character
    values: A, initial encounter, D, subsequent encounter and S, sequela. While
    the patient may be seen by a new or different provider over the course of
    treatment for an injury or condition, assignment of the 7th character for
    external cause should match the 7th character of the code assigned for the
    associated injury or condition for the encounter.
  </p>
  <p>3) Use the full range of external cause codes</p>
  <p>
    Use the full range of external cause codes to completely describe the cause,
    the intent, the place of occurrence, and if applicable, the activity of the
    patient at the time of the event, and the patient’s status, for all
    injuries, and other health conditions due to an external cause.
  </p>
  <p>4) Assign as many external cause codes as necessary</p>
  <p>
    Assign as many external cause codes as necessary to fully explain each
    cause. If only one external code can be recorded, assign the code most
    related to the principal diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>5) The selection of the appropriate external cause code</p>
  <p>
    The selection of the appropriate external cause code is guided by the
    Alphabetic Index of External Causes and by Inclusion and Exclusion notes in
    the Tabular List.
  </p>
  <p>6) External cause code can never be a principal diagnosis</p>
  <p>Page 83 of 115</p>
  <p>
    An external cause code can never be a principal (first-listed) diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>7) Combination external cause codes</p>
  <p>
    Certain of the external cause codes are combination codes that identify
    sequential events that result in an injury, such as a fall which results in
    striking against an object. The injury may be due to either event or both.
    The combination external cause code used should correspond to the sequence
    of events regardless of which caused the most serious injury.
  </p>
  <p>8) No external cause code needed in certain circumstances</p>
  <p>
    No external cause code from Chapter 20 is needed if the external cause and
    intent are included in a code from another chapter (e.g., T36.0X1-,
    Poisoning by penicillins, accidental (unintentional)).
  </p>
  <p>b. Place of Occurrence Guideline</p>
  <p>
    Codes from category Y92, Place of occurrence of the external cause, are
    secondary codes for use after other external cause codes to identify the
    location of the patient at the time of injury or other condition. Generally,
    a place of occurrence code is assigned only once, at the initial encounter
    for treatment. However, in the rare instance that a new injury occurs during
    hospitalization, an additional place of occurrence code may be assigned. No
    7th characters are used for Y92.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do not use place of occurrence code Y92.9 if the place is not stated or is
    not applicable.
  </p>
  <p>c. Activity Code</p>
  <p>
    Assign a code from category Y93, Activity code, to describe the activity of
    the patient at the time the injury or other health condition occurred. An
    activity code is used only once, at the initial encounter for treatment.
    Only one code from Y93 should be recorded on a medical record. The activity
    codes are not applicable to poisonings, adverse effects, misadventures or
    sequela.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do not assign Y93.9, Unspecified activity, if the activity is not stated. A
    code from category Y93 is appropriate for use with external cause and intent
    codes if identifying the activity provides additional information about the
    event.
  </p>
  <p>
    d. Place of Occurrence, Activity, and Status Codes Used with other External
    Cause Code
  </p>
  <p>
    When applicable, place of occurrence, activity, and external cause status
    codes are sequenced after the main external cause code(s). Regardless of the
    number of external cause codes assigned, generally there should be only one
    place of occurrence code, one activity code, and one external cause status
    code assigned
  </p>
  <p>Page 84 of 115</p>
  <p>
    to an encounter. However, in the rare instance that a new injury occurs
    during hospitalization, an additional place of occurrence code may be
    assigned.
  </p>
  <p>e. If the Reporting Format Limits the Number of External Cause Codes</p>
  <p>
    If the reporting format limits the number of external cause codes that can
    be used in reporting clinical data, report the code for the cause/intent
    most related to the principal diagnosis. If the format permits capture of
    additional external cause codes, the cause/intent, including medical
    misadventures, of the additional events should be reported rather than the
    codes for place, activity, or external status.
  </p>
  <p>f. Multiple External Cause Coding Guidelines</p>
  <p>
    More than one external cause code is required to fully describe the external
    cause of an illness or injury. The assignment of external cause codes should
    be sequenced in the following priority: If two or more events cause separate
    injuries, an external cause code should be assigned for each cause. The
    first-listed external cause code will be selected in the following order:
    External codes for child and adult abuse take priority over all other
    external cause codes. See Section I.C.19., Child and Adult abuse guidelines.
    External cause codes for terrorism events take priority over all other
    external cause codes except child and adult abuse. External cause codes for
    cataclysmic events take priority over all other external cause codes except
    child and adult abuse and terrorism. External cause codes for transport
    accidents take priority over all other external cause codes except
    cataclysmic events, child and adult abuse and terrorism. Activity and
    external cause status codes are assigned following all causal (intent)
    external cause codes. The first-listed external cause code should correspond
    to the cause of the most serious diagnosis due to an assault, accident, or
    self-harm, following the order of hierarchy listed above.
  </p>
  <p>g. Child and Adult Abuse Guideline</p>
  <p>
    Adult and child abuse, neglect and maltreatment are classified as assault.
    Any of the assault codes may be used to indicate the external cause of any
    injury resulting from the confirmed abuse.
  </p>
  <p> Page 85 of 115</p>
  <p>
    For confirmed cases of abuse, neglect and maltreatment, when the perpetrator
    is known, a code from Y07, Perpetrator of maltreatment and neglect, should
    accompany any other assault codes. See Section I.C.19. Adult and child
    abuse, neglect and other maltreatment
  </p>
  <p>h. Unknown or Undetermined Intent Guideline</p>
  <p>
    If the intent (accident, self-harm, assault) of the cause of an injury or
    other condition is unknown or unspecified, code the intent as accidental
    intent. All transport accident categories assume accidental intent.
  </p>
  <p>1) Use of undetermined intent</p>
  <p>
    External cause codes for events of undetermined intent are only for use if
    the documentation in the record specifies that the intent cannot be
    determined.
  </p>
  <p>i. Sequelae (Late Effects) of External Cause Guidelines</p>
  <p>1) Sequelae external cause codes</p>
  <p>
    Sequela are reported using the external cause code with the 7th character
    “S” for sequela. These codes should be used with any report of a late effect
    or sequela resulting from a previous injury. See Section I.B.10 Sequela
    (Late Effects)
  </p>
  <p>2) Sequela external cause code with a related current injury</p>
  <p>
    A sequela external cause code should never be used with a related current
    nature of injury code.
  </p>
  <p>3) Use of sequela external cause codes for subsequent visits</p>
  <p>
    Use a late effect external cause code for subsequent visits when a late
    effect of the initial injury is being treated. Do not use a late effect
    external cause code for subsequent visits for follow-up care (e.g., to
    assess healing, to receive rehabilitative therapy) of the injury when no
    late effect of the injury has been documented.
  </p>
  <p>j. Terrorism Guidelines</p>
  <p>
    1) Cause of injury identified by the Federal Government (FBI) as terrorism
  </p>
  <p>
    When the cause of an injury is identified by the Federal Government (FBI) as
    terrorism, the first-listed external cause code should be a code from
    category Y38, Terrorism. The definition of terrorism employed by the FBI is
    found at the inclusion note at the beginning of category Y38. Use additional
    code for place of occurrence (Y92.-). More than one Y38 code may be assigned
    if the injury is the result of more than one mechanism of terrorism.
  </p>
  <p>Page 86 of 115</p>
  <p>2) Cause of an injury is suspected to be the result of terrorism</p>
  <p>
    When the cause of an injury is suspected to be the result of terrorism a
    code from category Y38 should not be assigned. Suspected cases should be
    classified as assault.
  </p>
  <p>3) Code Y38.9, Terrorism, secondary effects</p>
  <p>
    Assign code Y38.9, Terrorism, secondary effects, for conditions occurring
    subsequent to the terrorist event. This code should not be assigned for
    conditions that are due to the initial terrorist act. It is acceptable to
    assign code Y38.9 with another code from Y38 if there is an injury due to
    the initial terrorist event and an injury that is a subsequent result of the
    terrorist event.
  </p>
  <p>k. External Cause Status</p>
  <p>
    A code from category Y99, External cause status, should be assigned whenever
    any other external cause code is assigned for an encounter, including an
    Activity code, except for the events noted below. Assign a code from
    category Y99, External cause status, to indicate the work status of the
    person at the time the event occurred. The status code indicates whether the
    event occurred during military activity, whether a non-military person was
    at work, whether an individual including a student or volunteer was involved
    in a non-work activity at the time of the causal event.
  </p>
  <p>
    A code from Y99, External cause status, should be assigned, when applicable,
    with other external cause codes, such as transport accidents and falls. The
    external cause status codes are not applicable to poisonings, adverse
    effects, misadventures or late effects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do not assign a code from category Y99 if no other external cause codes
    (cause, activity) are applicable for the encounter. An external cause status
    code is used only once, at the initial encounter for treatment. Only one
    code from Y99 should be recorded on a medical record. Do not assign code
    Y99.9, Unspecified external cause status, if the status is not stated.
  </p>
  <h4 id="IC21">
    21. Chapter 21: Factors influencing health status and contact with health
    services (Z00-Z99)
  </h4>
  <p>
    Note: The chapter specific guidelines provide additional information about
    the use of Z codes for specified encounters.
  </p>
  <p>a. Use of Z Codes in Any Healthcare Setting</p>
  <p>
    Z codes are for use in any healthcare setting. Z codes may be used as either
    a first-listed (principal diagnosis code in the inpatient setting) or
    secondary code, depending on the circumstances of the encounter. Certain Z
    codes may only be used as first-listed or principal diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>Page 87 of 115</p>
  <p>
    b. Z Codes Indicate a Reason for an Encounter or Provide Additional
    Information about a Patient Encounter
  </p>
  <p>
    Z codes are not procedure codes. A corresponding procedure code must
    accompany a Z code to describe any procedure performed.
  </p>
  <p>c. Categories of Z Codes</p>
  <p>1) Contact/Exposure</p>
  <p>
    Category Z20 indicates contact with, and suspected exposure to, communicable
    diseases. These codes are for patients who are suspected to have been
    exposed to a disease by close personal contact with an infected individual
    or are in an area where a disease is epidemic. Category Z77, Other contact
    with and (suspected) exposures hazardous to health, indicates contact with
    and suspected exposures hazardous to health.
  </p>
  <p>
    Contact/exposure codes may be used as a first-listed code to explain an
    encounter for testing, or, more commonly, as a secondary code to identify a
    potential risk.
  </p>
  <p>2) Inoculations and vaccinations</p>
  <p>
    Code Z23 is for encounters for inoculations and vaccinations. It indicates
    that a patient is being seen to receive a prophylactic inoculation against a
    disease. Procedure codes are required to identify the actual administration
    of the injection and the type(s) of immunizations given. Code Z23 may be
    used as a secondary code if the inoculation is given as a routine part of
    preventive health care, such as a well-baby visit.
  </p>
  <p>3) Status</p>
  <p>
    Status codes indicate that a patient is either a carrier of a disease or has
    the sequelae or residual of a past disease or condition. This includes such
    things as the presence of prosthetic or mechanical devices resulting from
    past treatment. A status code is informative, because the status may affect
    the course of treatment and its outcome. A status code is distinct from a
    history code. The history code indicates that the patient no longer has the
    condition.
  </p>
  <p>
    A status code should not be used with a diagnosis code from one of the body
    system chapters, if the diagnosis code includes the information provided by
    the status code. For example, code Z94.1, Heart transplant status, should
    not be used with a code from subcategory T86.2, Complications of heart
    transplant. The status code does not provide additional information. The
    complication code indicates that the patient is a heart transplant patient.
  </p>
  <p>Page 88 of 115</p>
  <p>
    For encounters for weaning from a mechanical ventilator, assign a code from
    subcategory J96.1, Chronic respiratory failure, followed by code Z99.11,
    Dependence on respirator [ventilator] status. The status Z codes/categories
    are: Z14 Genetic carrier
  </p>
  <p>
    Genetic carrier status indicates that a person carries a gene, associated
    with a particular disease, which may be passed to offspring who may develop
    that disease. The person does not have the disease and is not at risk of
    developing the disease.
  </p>
  <p>Z15 Genetic susceptibility to disease</p>
  <p>
    Genetic susceptibility indicates that a person has a gene that increases the
    risk of that person developing the disease. Codes from category Z15 should
    not be used as principal or first-listed codes. If the patient has the
    condition to which he/she is susceptible, and that condition is the reason
    for the encounter, the code for the current condition should be sequenced
    first. If the patient is being seen for follow-up after completed treatment
    for this condition, and the condition no longer exists, a follow-up code
    should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate personal history and
    genetic susceptibility codes. If the purpose of the encounter is genetic
    counseling associated with procreative management, code Z31.5, Encounter for
    genetic counseling, should be assigned as the first-listed code, followed by
    a code from category Z15. Additional codes should be assigned for any
    applicable family or personal history.
  </p>
  <p>Z16 Resistance to antimicrobial drugs</p>
  <p>
    This code indicates that a patient has a condition that is resistant to
    antimicrobial drug treatment. Sequence the infection code first.
  </p>
  <p>
    Z17 Estrogen receptor status Z18 Retained foreign body fragments Z19 Hormone
    sensitivity malignancy status Z21 Asymptomatic HIV infection status
  </p>
  <p>
    This code indicates that a patient has tested positive for HIV but has
    manifested no signs or symptoms of the disease.
  </p>
  <p>Z22 Carrier of infectious disease</p>
  <p>
    Carrier status indicates that a person harbors the specific organisms of a
    disease without manifest symptoms and is capable of transmitting the
    infection.
  </p>
  <p>Z28.3 Underimmunization status Z33.1 Pregnant state, incidental</p>
  <p>
    This code is a secondary code only for use when the pregnancy is in no way
    complicating the reason for visit. Otherwise, a code from the obstetric
    chapter is required.
  </p>
  <p>Z66 Do not resuscitate</p>
  <p>Page 89 of 115</p>
  <p>
    This code may be used when it is documented by the provider that a patient
    is on do not resuscitate status at any time during the stay.
  </p>
  <p>
    Z67 Blood type Z68 Body mass index (BMI) BMI codes should only be assigned
    when there is an associated, reportable diagnosis (such as obesity). Do not
    assign BMI codes during pregnancy. See Section I.B.14 for BMI documentation
    by clinicians other than the patient’s provider.
  </p>
  <p>
    Z74.01 Bed confinement status Z76.82 Awaiting organ transplant status Z78
    Other specified health status Code Z78.1, Physical restraint status, may be
    used when it is documented by the provider that a patient has been put in
    restraints during the current encounter. Please note that this code should
    not be reported when it is documented by the provider that a patient is
    temporarily restrained during a procedure. Z79 Long-term (current) drug
    therapy Codes from this category indicate a patient’s continuous use of a
    prescribed drug (including such things as aspirin therapy) for the long-term
    treatment of a condition or for prophylactic use. It is not for use for
    patients who have addictions to drugs. This subcategory is not for use of
    medications for detoxification or maintenance programs to prevent withdrawal
    symptoms (e.g., methadone maintenance for opiate dependence). Assign the
    appropriate code for the drug use, abuse, or dependence instead. Assign a
    code from Z79 if the patient is receiving a medication for an extended
    period as a prophylactic measure (such as for the prevention of deep vein
    thrombosis) or as treatment of a chronic condition (such as arthritis) or a
    disease requiring a lengthy course of treatment (such as cancer). Do not
    assign a code from category Z79 for medication being administered for a
    brief period of time to treat an acute illness or injury (such as a course
    of antibiotics to treat acute bronchitis). Z88 Allergy status to drugs,
    medicaments and biological substances Except: Z88.9, Allergy status to
    unspecified drugs, medicaments and biological substances status Z89 Acquired
    absence of limb Z90 Acquired absence of organs, not elsewhere classified
    Z91.0- Allergy status, other than to drugs and biological substances
  </p>
  <p>Page 90 of 115</p>
  <p>Z92.82</p>
  <p>
    Status post administration of tPA (rtPA) in a different facility within the
    last 24 hours prior to admission to a current facility Assign code Z92.82,
    Status post administration of tPA (rtPA) in a different facility within the
    last 24 hours prior to admission to current facility, as a secondary
    diagnosis when a patient is received by transfer into a facility and
    documentation indicates they were administered tissue plasminogen activator
    (tPA) within the last 24 hours prior to admission to the current facility.
    This guideline applies even if the patient is still receiving the tPA at the
    time they are received into the current facility. The appropriate code for
    the condition for which the tPA was administered (such as cerebrovascular
    disease or myocardial infarction) should be assigned first.
  </p>
  <p>
    Code Z92.82 is only applicable to the receiving facility record and not to
    the transferring facility record. Z93 Artificial opening status Z94
    Transplanted organ and tissue status Z95 Presence of cardiac and vascular
    implants and grafts Z96 Presence of other functional implants Z97 Presence
    of other devices Z98 Other postprocedural states Assign code Z98.85,
    Transplanted organ removal status, to indicate that a transplanted organ has
    been previously removed. This code should not be assigned for the encounter
    in which the transplanted organ is removed. The complication necessitating
    removal of the transplant organ should be assigned for that encounter. See
    section I.C19. for information on the coding of organ transplant
    complications. Z99 Dependence on enabling machines and devices, not
    elsewhere classified Note: Categories Z89-Z90 and Z93-Z99 are for use only
    if there are no complications or malfunctions of the organ or tissue
    replaced, the amputation site or the equipment on which the patient is
    dependent.
  </p>
  <p>
    4) History (of) There are two types of history Z codes, personal and family.
    Personal history codes explain a patient’s past medical condition that no
    longer exists and is not receiving any treatment, but that has the potential
    for recurrence, and therefore may require continued monitoring.
  </p>
  <p>Page 91 of 115</p>
  <p>
    Family history codes are for use when a patient has a family member(s) who
    has had a particular disease that causes the patient to be at higher risk of
    also contracting the disease. Personal history codes may be used in
    conjunction with follow-up codes and family history codes may be used in
    conjunction with screening codes to explain the need for a test or
    procedure. History codes are also acceptable on any medical record
    regardless of the reason for visit. A history of an illness, even if no
    longer present, is important information that may alter the type of
    treatment ordered. The reason for the encounter (for example, screening or
    counseling) should be sequenced first and the appropriate personal and/or
    family history code(s) should be assigned as additional diagnos(es).
  </p>
  <p>
    The history Z code categories are: Z80 Family history of primary malignant
    neoplasm Z81 Family history of mental and behavioral disorders Z82 Family
    history of certain disabilities and chronic diseases (leading to
    disablement) Z83 Family history of other specific disorders Z84 Family
    history of other conditions Z85 Personal history of malignant neoplasm Z86
    Personal history of certain other diseases Z87 Personal history of other
    diseases and conditions Z91.4Personal history of psychological trauma, not
    elsewhere classified Z91.5Personal history of self-harm Z91.81 History of
    falling Z91.82 Personal history of military deployment Z92 Personal history
    of medical treatment Except: Z92.0, Personal history of contraception
    Except: Z92.82, Status post administration of tPA (rtPA) in a different
    facility within the last 24 hours prior to admission to a current facility
  </p>
  <p>5) Screening</p>
  <p>
    Screening is the testing for disease or disease precursors in seemingly well
    individuals so that early detection and treatment can be provided for those
    who test positive for the disease (e.g., screening mammogram). The testing
    of a person to rule out or confirm a suspected diagnosis because the patient
    has some sign or symptom is a diagnostic examination, not a screening. In
    these cases, the sign or symptom is used to explain the reason for the test.
    A screening code may be a first-listed code if the reason for the visit is
    specifically the screening exam. It may also be used as an additional code
    if the screening is done during an office visit for other health
  </p>
  <p>Page 92 of 115</p>
  <p>
    problems. A screening code is not necessary if the screening is inherent to
    a routine examination, such as a pap smear done during a routine pelvic
    examination. Should a condition be discovered during the screening then the
    code for the condition may be assigned as an additional diagnosis. The Z
    code indicates that a screening exam is planned. A procedure code is
    required to confirm that the screening was performed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The screening Z codes/categories: Z11 Encounter for screening for infectious
    and parasitic diseases Z12 Encounter for screening for malignant neoplasms
    Z13 Encounter for screening for other diseases and disorders Except: Z13.9,
    Encounter for screening, unspecified Z36 Encounter for antenatal screening
    for mother
  </p>
  <p>
    6) Observation There are three observation Z code categories. They are for
    use in very limited circumstances when a person is being observed for a
    suspected condition that is ruled out. The observation codes are not for use
    if an injury or illness or any signs or symptoms related to the suspected
    condition are present. In such cases the diagnosis/symptom code is used with
    the corresponding external cause code.
  </p>
  <p>
    The observation codes are primarily to be used as a principal/first-listed
    diagnosis. An observation code may be assigned as a secondary diagnosis code
    when the patient is being observed for a condition that is ruled out and is
    unrelated to the principal/first-listed diagnosis. Also, when the principal
    diagnosis is required to be a code from category Z38, Liveborn infants
    according to place of birth and type of delivery, then a code from category
    Z05, Encounter for observation and evaluation of newborn for suspected
    diseases and conditions ruled out, is sequenced after the Z38 code.
    Additional codes may be used in addition to the observation code, but only
    if they are unrelated to the suspected condition being observed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Codes from subcategory Z03.7, Encounter for suspected maternal and fetal
    conditions ruled out, may either be used as a first-listed or as an
    additional code assignment depending on the case. They are for use in very
    limited circumstances on a maternal record when an encounter is for a
    suspected maternal or fetal condition that is ruled out during that
    encounter (for example, a maternal or fetal condition may be suspected due
    to an abnormal test result). These codes should not be used when the
    condition is confirmed. In those cases, the confirmed condition should be
    coded. In addition, these codes are not for use if an illness or any signs
    or symptoms related to the suspected condition or problem are present. In
    such cases the diagnosis/symptom code is used.
  </p>
  <p>Page 93 of 115</p>
  <p>
    Additional codes may be used in addition to the code from subcategory Z03.7,
    but only if they are unrelated to the suspected condition being evaluated.
  </p>
  <p>
    Codes from subcategory Z03.7 may not be used for encounters for antenatal
    screening of mother. See Section I.C.21. Screening. For encounters for
    suspected fetal condition that are inconclusive following testing and
    evaluation, assign the appropriate code from category O35, O36, O40 or O41.
  </p>
  <p>
    The observation Z code categories: Z03 Encounter for medical observation for
    suspected diseases and conditions ruled out Z04 Encounter for examination
    and observation for other reasons Except: Z04.9, Encounter for examination
    and observation for unspecified reason Z05 Encounter for observation and
    evaluation of newborn for suspected diseases and conditions ruled out
  </p>
  <p>7) Aftercare</p>
  <p>
    Aftercare visit codes cover situations when the initial treatment of a
    disease has been performed and the patient requires continued care during
    the healing or recovery phase, or for the long-term consequences of the
    disease. The aftercare Z code should not be used if treatment is directed at
    a current, acute disease. The diagnosis code is to be used in these cases.
    Exceptions to this rule are codes Z51.0, Encounter for antineoplastic
    radiation therapy, and codes from subcategory Z51.1, Encounter for
    antineoplastic chemotherapy and immunotherapy. These codes are to be first
    listed, followed by the diagnosis code when a patient’s encounter is solely
    to receive radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy for the
    treatment of a neoplasm. If the reason for the encounter is more than one
    type of antineoplastic therapy, code Z51.0 and a code from subcategory Z51.1
    may be assigned together, in which case one of these codes would be reported
    as a secondary diagnosis. The aftercare Z codes should also not be used for
    aftercare for injuries. For aftercare of an injury, assign the acute injury
    code with the appropriate 7th character (for subsequent encounter).
  </p>
  <p>
    The aftercare codes are generally first listed to explain the specific
    reason for the encounter. An aftercare code may be used as an additional
    code when some type of aftercare is provided in addition to the reason for
    admission and no diagnosis code is applicable. An example of this would be
    the closure of a colostomy during an encounter for treatment of another
    condition.
  </p>
  <p>Page 94 of 115</p>
  <p>
    Aftercare codes should be used in conjunction with other aftercare codes or
    diagnosis codes to provide better detail on the specifics of an aftercare
    encounter visit, unless otherwise directed by the classification. The
    sequencing of multiple aftercare codes depends on the circumstances of the
    encounter. Certain aftercare Z code categories need a secondary diagnosis
    code to describe the resolving condition or sequelae. For others, the
    condition is included in the code title.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additional Z code aftercare category terms include fitting and adjustment,
    and attention to artificial openings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Status Z codes may be used with aftercare Z codes to indicate the nature of
    the aftercare. For example, code Z95.1, Presence of aortocoronary bypass
    graft, may be used with code Z48.812, Encounter for surgical aftercare
    following surgery on the circulatory system, to indicate the surgery for
    which the aftercare is being performed. A status code should not be used
    when the aftercare code indicates the type of status, such as using Z43.0,
    Encounter for attention to tracheostomy, with Z93.0, Tracheostomy status.
  </p>
  <p>
    The aftercare Z category/codes: Z42 Encounter for plastic and reconstructive
    surgery following medical procedure or healed injury Z43 Encounter for
    attention to artificial openings Z44 Encounter for fitting and adjustment of
    external prosthetic device Z45 Encounter for adjustment and management of
    implanted device Z46 Encounter for fitting and adjustment of other devices
    Z47 Orthopedic aftercare Z48 Encounter for other postprocedural aftercare
    Z49 Encounter for care involving renal dialysis Z51 Encounter for other
    aftercare and medical care
  </p>
  <p>
    8) Follow-up The follow-up codes are used to explain continuing surveillance
    following completed treatment of a disease, condition, or injury. They imply
    that the condition has been fully treated and no longer exists. They should
    not be confused with aftercare codes, or injury codes with a 7th character
    for subsequent encounter, that explain ongoing care of a healing condition
    or its sequelae. Follow-up codes may be used in conjunction with history
    codes to provide the full picture of the healed condition and its treatment.
    The follow-up code is sequenced first, followed by the history code.
  </p>
  <p>
    A follow-up code may be used to explain multiple visits. Should a condition
    be found to have recurred on the follow-up visit, then the
  </p>
  <p>Page 95 of 115</p>
  <p>
    diagnosis code for the condition should be assigned in place of the
    follow-up code. The follow-up Z code categories: Z08 Encounter for follow-up
    examination after completed treatment for malignant neoplasm Z09 Encounter
    for follow-up examination after completed treatment for conditions other
    than malignant neoplasm Z39 Encounter for maternal postpartum care and
    examination
  </p>
  <p>9) Donor</p>
  <p>
    Codes in category Z52, Donors of organs and tissues, are used for living
    individuals who are donating blood or other body tissue. These codes are for
    individuals donating for others, as well as for self-donations. They are not
    used to identify cadaveric donations.
  </p>
  <p>10) Counseling</p>
  <p>
    Counseling Z codes are used when a patient or family member receives
    assistance in the aftermath of an illness or injury, or when support is
    required in coping with family or social problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    The counseling Z codes/categories: Z30.0 Encounter for general counseling
    and advice on contraception Z31.5 Encounter for procreative genetic
    counseling Z31.6Encounter for general counseling and advice on procreation
    Z32.2 Encounter for childbirth instruction Z32.3 Encounter for childcare
    instruction Z69 Encounter for mental health services for victim and
    perpetrator of abuse Z70 Counseling related to sexual attitude, behavior and
    orientation Z71 Persons encountering health services for other counseling
    and medical advice, not elsewhere classified Note: Code Z71.84, Encounter
    for health counseling related to travel, is to be used for health risk and
    safety counseling for future travel purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Code Z71.85, Encounter for immunization safety counseling, is to be used for
    counseling of the patient or caregiver regarding the safety of a vaccine.
    This code should not be used for the provision of general information
    regarding risks and potential side effects during routine encounters for the
    administration of vaccines. Z76.81 Expectant mother prebirth pediatrician
    visit
  </p>
  <p>
    11) Encounters for Obstetrical and Reproductive Services See Section I.C.15.
    Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Puerperium, for further instruction on the
    use of these codes.
  </p>
  <p>Page 96 of 115</p>
  <p>
    Z codes for pregnancy are for use in those circumstances when none of the
    problems or complications included in the codes from the Obstetrics chapter
    exist (a routine prenatal visit or postpartum care). Codes in category Z34,
    Encounter for supervision of normal pregnancy, are always first listed and
    are not to be used with any other code from the OB chapter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Codes in category Z3A, Weeks of gestation, may be assigned to provide
    additional information about the pregnancy. Category Z3A codes should not be
    assigned for pregnancies with abortive outcomes (categories O00O08),
    elective termination of pregnancy (code Z33.2), nor for postpartum
    conditions, as category Z3A is not applicable to these conditions. The date
    of the admission should be used to determine weeks of gestation for
    inpatient admissions that encompass more than one gestational week.
  </p>
  <p>
    The outcome of delivery, category Z37, should be included on all maternal
    delivery records. It is always a secondary code. Codes in category Z37
    should not be used on the newborn record. Z codes for family planning
    (contraceptive) or procreative management and counseling should be included
    on an obstetric record either during the pregnancy or the postpartum stage,
    if applicable. Z codes/categories for obstetrical and reproductive services:
    Z30 Encounter for contraceptive management Z31 Encounter for procreative
    management Z32.2 Encounter for childbirth instruction Z32.3 Encounter for
    childcare instruction Z33 Pregnant state Z34 Encounter for supervision of
    normal pregnancy Z36 Encounter for antenatal screening of mother Z3A Weeks
    of gestation Z37 Outcome of delivery Z39 Encounter for maternal postpartum
    care and examination Z76.81 Expectant mother prebirth pediatrician visit
  </p>
  <p>12) Newborns and Infants</p>
  <p>
    See Section I.C.16. Newborn (Perinatal) Guidelines, for further instruction
    on the use of these codes. Newborn Z codes/categories: Z76.1 Encounter for
    health supervision and care of foundling Z00.1Encounter for routine child
    health examination Z38 Liveborn infants according to place of birth and type
    of delivery
  </p>
  <p>13) Routine and Administrative Examinations</p>
  <p>Page 97 of 115</p>
  <p>
    The Z codes allow for the description of encounters for routine
    examinations, such as, a general check-up, or, examinations for
    administrative purposes, such as, a pre-employment physical. The codes are
    not to be used if the examination is for diagnosis of a suspected condition
    or for treatment purposes. In such cases the diagnosis code is used. During
    a routine exam, should a diagnosis or condition be discovered, it should be
    coded as an additional code. Pre-existing and chronic conditions and history
    codes may also be included as additional codes as long as the examination is
    for administrative purposes and not focused on any particular condition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the codes for routine health examinations distinguish between “with”
    and “without” abnormal findings. Code assignment depends on the information
    that is known at the time the encounter is being coded. For example, if no
    abnormal findings were found during the examination, but the encounter is
    being coded before test results are back, it is acceptable to assign the
    code for “without abnormal findings.” When assigning a code for “with
    abnormal findings,” additional code(s) should be assigned to identify the
    specific abnormal finding(s). Pre-operative examination and pre-procedural
    laboratory examination Z codes are for use only in those situations when a
    patient is being cleared for a procedure or surgery and no treatment is
    given.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Z codes/categories for routine and administrative examinations: Z00
    Encounter for general examination without complaint, suspected or reported
    diagnosis Z01 Encounter for other special examination without complaint,
    suspected or reported diagnosis Z02 Encounter for administrative examination
    Except: Z02.9, Encounter for administrative examinations, unspecified Z32.0
    Encounter for pregnancy test
  </p>
  <p>14) Miscellaneous Z Codes</p>
  <p>
    The miscellaneous Z codes capture a number of other health care encounters
    that do not fall into one of the other categories. Some of these codes
    identify the reason for the encounter; others are for use as additional
    codes that provide useful information on circumstances that may affect a
    patient’s care and treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prophylactic Organ Removal For encounters specifically for prophylactic
    removal of an organ (such as prophylactic removal of breasts due to a
    genetic susceptibility to cancer or a family history of cancer), the
    principal or first-listed code should be a code from category Z40, Encounter
    for prophylactic surgery, followed by the appropriate codes to identify the
    associated risk factor (such as genetic susceptibility or family history).
  </p>
  <p>Page 98 of 115</p>
  <p>
    If the patient has a malignancy of one site and is having prophylactic
    removal at another site to prevent either a new primary malignancy or
    metastatic disease, a code for the malignancy should also be assigned in
    addition to a code from subcategory Z40.0, Encounter for prophylactic
    surgery for risk factors related to malignant neoplasms. A Z40.0 code should
    not be assigned if the patient is having organ removal for treatment of a
    malignancy, such as the removal of the testes for the treatment of prostate
    cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Miscellaneous Z codes/categories: Z28 Immunization not carried out Except:
    Z28.3, Underimmunization status Z29 Encounter for other prophylactic
    measures Z40 Encounter for prophylactic surgery Z41 Encounter for procedures
    for purposes other than remedying health state Except: Z41.9, Encounter for
    procedure for purposes other than remedying health state, unspecified Z53
    Persons encountering health services for specific procedures and treatment,
    not carried out Z72 Problems related to lifestyle Note: These codes should
    be assigned only when the documentation specifies that the patient has an
    associated problem Z73 Problems related to life management difficulty Z74
    Problems related to care provider dependency Except: Z74.01, Bed confinement
    status Z75 Problems related to medical facilities and other health care
    Z76.0 Encounter for issue of repeat prescription Z76.3 Healthy person
    accompanying sick person Z76.4 Other boarder to healthcare facility Z76.5
    Malingerer [conscious simulation] Z91.1Patient’s noncompliance with medical
    treatment and regimen Z91.83 Wandering in diseases classified elsewhere
    Z91.84- Oral health risk factors Z91.89 Other specified personal risk
    factors, not elsewhere classified
  </p>
  <p>
    See Section I.B.14 for Z55-Z65 Persons with potential health hazards related
    to socioeconomic and psychosocial circumstances, documentation by clinicians
    other than the patient’s provider
  </p>
  <p>15) Nonspecific Z Codes</p>
  <p>
    Certain Z codes are so non-specific, or potentially redundant with other
    codes in the classification, that there can be little justification for
    their use in the inpatient setting. Their use in the outpatient setting
    should be limited to those instances when there is no further documentation
    to permit more precise coding. Otherwise, any sign or symptom or any other
    reason for visit that is captured in another code should be used.
  </p>

  <p>17) Social Determinants of Health</p>
  <p>Page 100 of 115</p>
  <p>
    Codes describing social determinants of health (SDOH) should be assigned
    when this information is documented. For social determinants of health, such
    as information found in categories Z55-Z65, Persons with potential health
    hazards related to socioeconomic and psychosocial circumstances, code
    assignment may be based on medical record documentation from clinicians
    involved in the care of the patient who are not the patient’s provider since
    this information represents social information, rather than medical
    diagnoses. For example, coding professionals may utilize documentation of
    social information from social workers, community health workers, case
    managers, or nurses, if their documentation is included in the official
    medical record. Patient self-reported documentation may be used to assign
    codes for social determinants of health, as long as the patient
    self-reported information is signed-off by and incorporated into the medical
    record by either a clinician or provider. Social determinants of health
    codes are located primarily in these Z code categories:

  <p>
    Z55 Problems related to education and literacy Z56 Problems related to
    employment and unemployment Z57 Occupational exposure to risk factors Z58
    Problems related to physical environment Z59 Problems related to housing and
    economic circumstances Z60 Problems related to social environment Z62
    Problems related to upbringing Z63 Other problems related to primary support
    group, including family circumstances Z64 Problems related to certain
    psychosocial circumstances Z65 Problems related to other psychosocial
    circumstances
